// Intake (intake) decision-log store — shared type contract (spec 043 C1).
//
// The intake pipeline's full-outcome decision log, mirroring grooming's
// `CurationStore` run/operation shape (`curation-types.ts`) but for the
// intake sweep. It is a purely observational sidecar: it records what the
// intake judge decided + how each plan was applied (applied | proposed | skipped
// | failed) and NEVER influences filing. The concrete JSON-sidecar implementation
// lives in `sidecar/intake-store.ts`; the contract is re-exported from
// `intake-store.ts` to match the curation-store layering.
//
// Unlike grooming, intake has no slice/evidence/lock seam (one submission at a
// time, not a batched curation pass), so this store is deliberately the minimal
// run + operation subset of `CurationStore` — no `gatherMemoryEvidence` /
// `listGroomingSlices` / `findRunningRun`.
