// Shared "split" store primitive (spec 043 D-B). The mechanics of spinning a
// source memory into N replacements live HERE, in one place, so the two curator
// apply paths that perform a split — grooming (`curator-apply.ts`) and intake
// (`intake/apply.ts`) — produce byte-identical results.
//
// What the primitive owns (the invariant both paths share):
//   1. Create every replacement FIRST, collecting their ids.
//   2. ONLY THEN, optionally, archive the source.
// This create-then-archive ordering is the data-loss-safe one: on a partial
// failure the source stays active (recoverable next run) rather than being lost
// before its replacements exist (cf. the merge note in curator-apply.ts).
//
// What the primitive does NOT own (deliberately left to each caller, because the
// two curators differ here): how each replacement's `createMemory` input + options
// are built — the curator_note shape (grooming: { run_id, supersedes }; intake:
// { source: "intake", rationale, … }), ownership/agent_id, and whether the
// new rows land active or `requires_approval` (proposed). Each caller pre-builds
// those `{ input, options }` pairs; the primitive only sequences the writes.
//
// Whether the source is archived is the propose-vs-apply switch: pass
// `archiveActorId` to archive it (an auto-applied split supersedes its source);
// omit it to leave the source untouched (a PROPOSED split — a human accepts and
// archives the source later). Intake ALWAYS proposes, so it always omits it.
