// Intake — the per-item orchestrator (spec 035 §F5). Composes the inbox
// queue + the pipeline into one callable: claim → parse → navigate → judge →
// apply → complete. The scheduler (boot-scan + 5-min tick + chokidar) drives
// this over the inbox; it's a separate increment.
//
// Everything it needs is injected (vault, recall, listActive, llmClient, store),
// so it's testable end-to-end with a temp vault + fakes — no network, no real
// index. A claim lost to another worker, or an unusable model response, returns
// a value-free status rather than throwing.
