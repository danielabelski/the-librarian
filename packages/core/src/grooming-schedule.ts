// "run every N days at HH:MM" in the server's LOCAL time. The Grooming scheduler
// uses this to decide whether a *pass* is due; the content input-hash idempotency
// (D-3a) then decides which slices actually do work. (The old per-slice
// minute-interval gate — isIntervalDue/isSliceDue — is retired, spec 045 D-3a.)
//
// Deliberately days-only: no weeks/months unit, no calendar-month arithmetic
// (no setMonth, no month-length clamps). "Weekly" is 7, "~monthly" is 30. We
// anchor each fire to the local {time} via component construction (setHours),
// NOT a blind `+ N * 86400000` ms, so the wall-clock hour stays put across DST
// — 03:00 in winter is still 03:00 in summer.

 *   fresh install first grooms at the next `time`, not immediately at boot.)
 * - **Has run before**: due once `now >= nextScheduleFire(lastRunAt, …)` — the

 *   once-per-window guard: because the next fire is anchored to a *later* date,

 *
 * **DST.** Anchoring to local `time` keeps the wall-clock hour fixed across the
 * year. On the spring-forward day a `time` inside the skipped hour doesn't
 * exist; `new Date` normalises it forward (e.g. 02:30 → 03:30 EDT), so the pass
 * fires on the first poll after the clock passes the slot rather than being
 * skipped. The fall-back day is the once-per-window guard's job — covered by the
 * "later date" anchor above. We accept the rare first-poll-after-the-gap timing
 * on spring-forward; over-engineering an exact-instant gate isn't worth it for a
 * nightly maintenance job.
