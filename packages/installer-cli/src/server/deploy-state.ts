// The NON-SECRET deploy-state file for the `server` command group.
//
// `up` runs the container with a chosen bind host, data volume, and ref, but
// none of that was persisted anywhere — so `update` couldn't recreate the
// container with the same config and `status` couldn't report the deployed ref
// reliably (it would have to guess via `git describe`). This file records that
// config in the deploy dir (default `~/.librarian/server/deploy-state.json`).
//
// SECURITY (AGENTS.md / spec §11): this file is NON-SECRET by construction. It
// carries ONLY the five fields below — a bind host, a volume name, a ref, an
// image tag, and the container name. It NEVER carries a bearer token, master
// key, or admin token. `writeDeployState` whitelists exactly those fields, so a
// caller that accidentally passes extra keys (a smuggled secret) cannot leak
// them into the file. The master key / admin token are surfaced to stdout once
// by `up` and persisted nowhere host-side — that contract is unchanged.
