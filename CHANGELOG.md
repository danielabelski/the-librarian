# Changelog

All notable changes to **The Librarian** are documented in this file. The
format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This changelog starts at v0.1.0 — the first version likely to see public
adoption. The pre-v0.1.0 development history lives in the git log; only
changes from this point forward are catalogued here.

## [1.0.0-rc.4] — 2026-06-13

Installer-CLI fixes for the interactive setup (`@the-librarian/cli`). Needs a
republish to npm to reach users.

### Fixed

- **Interactive token prompt no longer drops the second answer.** `librarian
  install` built a fresh `readline` interface per question and closed it after
  each one; closing the first interface discarded any input buffered past its
  line, so when both answers arrived together (a paste, or a fast/piped run) the
  token read saw no input and hung — `resolveConfig` then failed with
  "MCP URL and token are required". The prompter now uses ONE shared readline
  interface for its whole lifetime, created lazily on the first real prompt and
  reused for every question, with a persistent line queue so no input is lost
  regardless of chunking. The secret (token) echo is muted only for that one
  question and restored afterwards. A new `Prompter.close()` (called from the
  install/uninstall lifecycle) tears the interface down so an open readline no
  longer keeps the event loop alive and the process exits cleanly.

### Added

- **Reuse existing `LIBRARIAN_*` environment variables.** When
  `~/.librarian/env` isn't already complete, `librarian install` now consults
  `LIBRARIAN_MCP_URL` / `LIBRARIAN_AGENT_TOKEN` from the environment instead of
  blindly prompting. With BOTH present it shows them (URL in full, token
  redacted to `LIBRARIAN_AGENT_TOKEN=set` — never the value) and asks
  `Use the LIBRARIAN_MCP_URL and LIBRARIAN_AGENT_TOKEN from your environment?
  [Y/n]`; accept reuses and persists them, decline prompts for fresh values.
  With only ONE present it prefills that prompt's default so a bare enter
  accepts it. The environment is injectable for tests, and the token value is
  never logged.

## [1.0.0-rc.3] — 2026-06-13

The cross-harness installer CLI (`docs/specs/2026-06-13-installer-cli.md`,
Phase 1). One bootstrap line installs a small `librarian` CLI that drives each
harness's native install path — the package-manager-style tool you keep, instead
of hand-editing five config formats.

### Added

- **`librarian` installer CLI** (`@the-librarian/cli`, bin `librarian`) — a thin
  cross-harness orchestrator for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes, and Pi.
  `librarian install` (interactive multi-select; prompts once for MCP URL +
  token), `uninstall`, `update`, plus a live `status` table, `doctor`
  diagnostics, and `config`. Each harness is detected and skipped (`not-detected`)
  rather than erroring when its CLI is absent. Operations are idempotent and
  roll back per-step on error. Phase 1 is local-only; server reporting
  (`report`) and CLI `self-update` land in a later release.
- **Install with `npm i -g @the-librarian/cli` then `librarian install`** — any
  harness you'd install into already has Node, so there's no bootstrap script;
  the two commands install the CLI globally and hand off to the interactive
  setup (`librarian install` prompts once for MCP URL + token and multi-selects
  harnesses).
- **Env + machine identity** — the CLI writes `~/.librarian/env` (`chmod 600`)
  with `LIBRARIAN_MCP_URL` + `LIBRARIAN_AGENT_TOKEN`, adds one idempotent managed
  block to the shell rc (bash/zsh source it; fish gets a native
  `conf.d/librarian.fish`), and stamps a per-machine `~/.librarian/machine-id`.
  The token is never printed and never leaves `~/.librarian/env`.

### Changed

- **Pi npm package renamed** from the unpublishable `@librarian/pi-extension`
  (an npm scope nobody owns) to `@the-librarian/pi-extension` — scoped under
  the new `@the-librarian` npm org the owner controls, with
  `publishConfig.access: public` so the scoped package publishes publicly.
  The old unscoped `the-librarian-pi-extension` (v0.4.0), published from the
  pre-1.0 repo, will be `npm deprecate`d post-publish to point at the new
  `@the-librarian/pi-extension` name. The Pi package and the Claude
  marketplace manifest are now version-aligned to the root.

- **Installer CLI package name** — published as the scoped **`@the-librarian/cli`**
  (with `"publishConfig": { "access": "public" }`), owner decision. The bootstrap
  one-liner and spec §2/§7 use `npm i -g @the-librarian/cli`.

### Fixed

- **Hermes adapter extraction** — the codeload tarball nests the adapter four
  path components deep (`the-librarian-<ref>/integrations/hermes/librarian/**`),
  so `tar --strip-components` is now `4` (was `3`). Files land at the plugin-dir
  root, so a fresh-machine install + `detect()` round-trips. Regression test
  drives the real `tar` path against a codeload-shaped fixture.
- **Hermes pinned ref** — `PINNED_REF` now tracks the published package version
  (`v1.0.0-rc.3`), so the adapter fetch no longer 404s on a fresh machine; a test
  pins `PINNED_REF === "v" + <package version>` so it can't drift again.
- **OpenCode uninstall no longer removes a foreign `…/primer.md`** — install
  stamps the exact primer URL it added into the managed `mcp.librarian` block,
  and uninstall removes only that exact `instructions` entry, leaving unrelated
  primer entries intact.
- **Non-interactive install with no saved config fails cleanly** — a missing MCP
  URL/token in a non-interactive run now prints one friendly line and exits 1
  instead of leaking a `MissingValueError` stack trace.
- **Install defers global side effects until a harness succeeds** —
  `~/.librarian/env` + the managed shell rc block are written only after at least
  one harness install succeeds, so a run where every harness fails leaves no
  global state behind.

## [1.0.0-rc.1] — 2026-06-12

Phases 1–5 of the v1.0 rethink (`docs/specs/2026-06-12-rethink.md`): carve the
system down to ONE curator with ONE apply rule and ONE prompt, close the
Phase 1 review findings, land the primer + the pinned 7-verb agent surface +
the five in-tree harness integrations, give the dashboard its Obsidian-lite
vault explorer/editor with per-file history/diff/restore plus the
activity-feed audit trail and the guarded whole-vault restore (T18–T21),
make `search_references` fast + end-to-end searchable (persistent embedding
cache + chunked retrieval, T23/T24), and ship the one-shot `migrate-data-dir`
CLI for legacy data dirs (T26). Promotes to `1.0.0` once the owner's
live instance migrates cleanly.

### Added — Phase 5 (data-dir migration)

- **`migrate-data-dir` CLI command** (rethink T26, spec §10) —
  `pnpm --filter @librarian/cli migrate-data-dir [--data-dir <path>]` migrates
  a pre-1.0 data dir in one idempotent pass and prints a three-section report
  (changes made / archivable artifacts / needs the operator). It verifies the
  vault is a git repo (initializing + making the initial commit through the
  same GitOps path the server boot uses when not), renames the intake decision
  log `consolidation-runs.json` → `intake-runs.json` (the store reads the
  legacy name as a one-time fallback until the rename), strips the retired
  frontmatter fields (`domain`, `category`, `visibility`, `scope`,
  `actor_kind`, `last_recalled_at`, and CuratorNote's
  `addendum_version`/`dry_run`/`dry_run_candidate`) from every memory doc in
  ONE sweep commit (`migrate: strip retired frontmatter fields`), and removes
  the retired settings keys (the classifier-era `classifier.*` surface, the
  pre-D13 `curator.grooming.default_auto_apply` +
  `curator.grooming.auto_apply_confidence`/`curator.auto_apply_confidence` —
  each removal reports the old value next to the new 0.8 default under
  `curator.apply.confidence_threshold`, spec §15.3 — the under-evaluation
  `addendum_status`/`addendum_eval_version` pair, the `LIBRARIAN_CONSOLIDATOR`
  -era seed sources `curator.enabled`/`curator.interval_minutes`/
  `curator.schedule.*`, and the post-primer-seed `awareness.primer`/
  `working_style`), running the boot seed migrations FIRST so no value is
  removed before it migrated. **It never deletes data:** `librarian.sqlite`,
  `events.jsonl`, the root `memories.md`, `conv-state.json`,
  `*.predeprecation.bak` files, dry-run-tagged proposals, stuck
  `agent_private` curation lock rows, and an over-2KB migrated primer are
  reported (with sizes) for the operator; an unreadable secret legacy value
  (master key absent) is left in place with a note instead of being destroyed
  unread. A second run reports "nothing to do" and creates no commits.
- **Boot warn-only migration checks** — the HTTP server boot now runs the same
  detections read-only and logs one `data-dir migration: …` warning line per
  finding (fail-soft; never blocks boot, never mutates). The mutations belong
  to the CLI command.

### Added — Phase 4 (references completion)

- **Persistent embedding cache** (rethink T23, spec §9 / D5) — a sidecar at
  `<data-dir>/embeddings-cache/` (outside the vault, never git-committed)
  stores per-file chunk vectors keyed by relative path + content hash + a
  stable embedder model id (`Embedder.modelId`; hash and llama key separately,
  so switching embedders can never serve a wrong-model vector). A process
  restart re-embeds nothing that hasn't changed — references AND memory index
  builds ride the same cache. Records invalidate per file on content-hash (or
  chunking) mismatch; orphan entries for deleted files are pruned
  opportunistically during index builds/searches; every disk op is fail-soft
  (a corrupt/torn record is a miss, never a throw — the cache can be deleted
  wholesale at any time).
- **Chunked reference indexing + retrieval** (rethink T24, spec §9 / D5) —
  `search_references` no longer embeds a reference as one (truncated) blob.
  References are split by heading structure first, then into size-bounded
  windows inside oversized sections (max 6000 chars ≈ 1500–2000 tokens, with
  600 chars of overlap so a fact straddling a cut embeds whole somewhere);
  each chunk is indexed keyword+vector (same RRF hybrid index) and the
  best-ranked chunk per file returns with the file path id + a
  heading-breadcrumb `anchor` + a bounded excerpt + `startChar`/`endChar`
  range. Wire-compatible: `id`/`score`/`section` unchanged, the new fields are
  additive. A >100KB document is now searchable in its tail sections (pinned
  by test).

### Added — Phase 3 (history / diff / rollback)

- **Per-file history, diff, and restore** (rethink T20, spec §8 / D16) — the
  vault file view gains a **History** tab: the file's commit list (newest
  first, following renames — pre-rename versions stay addressable and
  diffable under the path they had then), a unified-diff view per version
  ("what this commit changed", rendered as a dependency-free `<pre>` with
  +/- line colouring), and **"Restore this version"** behind a confirm
  dialog. A restore writes the chosen version's content back as a **new
  commit** through the same validated store write path as every other
  mutation (per-kind validation, commit-per-write, recall-index
  invalidation) — history is never rewritten, and a version that no longer
  passes the file type's CURRENT validation is refused with the errors and
  a pointer to the manual-edit path. Backed by a new core git-history
  reader (`git log --follow` / `show` / `diff` over the existing sync
  shell-out plumbing, every revision argument validated as plain hex before
  reaching argv) and new admin-gated tRPC procedures
  (`vault.history`/`atCommit`/`diff`/`restoreVersion`).
- **Vault activity feed — the audit trail** (rethink T21, spec §8 / D16) — a
  new **Activity** page under the Vault section (`/vault/activity`) lists the
  vault's recent git commits newest-first, each with the files it touched and
  a provenance badge (**agent** / **curator** / **admin** / **system**)
  derived server-side from the commit-subject conventions (`inbox: submit` /
  `memory: flag` / `handoff: store|claim` → agent; `inbox: consolidate
  sweep`, `curator: …`, and the `memory: store|propose|update|archive`
  lifecycle writes → curator; `vault: …`, `primer: update`, and the
  admin-only memory/handoff verbs → admin). Served by a new admin-gated tRPC
  `activity` router (`feed` with `limit`/`before` paging). **This view
  replaces the event ledger's old logs view** (D7/D16): the git history IS
  the audit trail — no separate ledger exists.
- **Guarded whole-vault restore** (rethink T21, spec §8 / D16) —
  `activity.restoreVault` rolls every vault file back to a chosen commit's
  tree state, guarded exactly as D16 orders: the dashboard modal makes the
  admin **type `RESTORE`** and the **server validates the phrase** (the UI
  ceremony can't be bypassed); the **curator/intake pause** for the duration
  via a dedicated in-process + TTL-bounded settings signal both tick
  entrypoints check before anything else (run-now included — and distinct
  from the operator's `enabled` settings, which come back untouched); a
  **`pre-restore-<timestamp>` tag** anchors the old HEAD (shown in the
  success state); the tree revert lands as **ONE new commit** (`vault:
  restore to <hash>` — never a history rewrite); the recall index is
  invalidated and rebuilds from markdown by construction; the curator resumes
  in a `finally`, so a mid-sequence failure still resumes it and the error
  reports honestly how far the sequence got. Restores are refused while a
  curation/intake run is in flight and while another restore is running
  (simple process-wide lock).

### Added — Phase 3 (dashboard vault explorer/editor)

- **Vault explorer** (rethink T18, spec §8 / D15) — a new top-level dashboard
  surface (`/vault`) over the WHOLE vault: a file tree (memories/, handoffs/,
  references/, `.curator/`, `primer.md` — `.git`, the disposable `.index/`,
  and the intake's transient `inbox/` queue are deliberately invisible) plus a
  file view with rendered markdown (react-markdown — the dashboard's first
  markdown renderer, chosen as the lightest standard element-tree option, no
  raw HTML), the frontmatter as a property table, **clickable wikilinks**
  (resolved server-side by filename stem / frontmatter id / title / alias —
  the same naming the wikilink machinery uses) and a **backlinks pane**
  ("what links here", from a vault-wide link index). Backed by a new
  admin-gated tRPC `vault` router (`tree`/`read`/`resolve`) over a new
  `store.vaultFiles` surface; every path from the browser is re-validated —
  traversal (`..`), absolute paths, and symlink tricks are rejected before
  touching disk.
- **Vault editor** (rethink T19, spec §8 / D15) — raw markdown editing with
  create/rename/delete (confirm dialogs), all through the store layer: one
  git commit per write, recall-index invalidation on the existing onWrite
  path, never a raw fs write. Saves validate for the file's type BEFORE
  writing — memories against the memory frontmatter schema, handoffs against
  the frontmatter + five-section contract (missing headings are named),
  `primer.md`/`.curator/*` against the 2 KB cap (with a live byte budget in
  the editor), references and plain files lenient — and an invalid document
  is refused with the teaching errors inline, never written. Saves are
  **compare-and-swap** on the content hash captured at load: a file changed
  underneath comes back as a conflict (reload + reapply), never a silent
  last-write-wins. Renames rewrite wikilinks targeting the old filename stem
  across the vault (the existing link-integrity machinery), so nothing
  dangles.

### Added — Phase 2 (primer + 7-verb surface)

- **The primer is now a vault file: `vault/primer.md`** (rethink T11, spec
  §5.2 / D9–D11) — one ≤2KB operator-editable document, seeded on first boot
  with a shipped default that teaches the recall/remember loop, the handoff
  protocol (`store_handoff` with the five sections; `list_handoffs` →
  `claim_handoff` to take over), the learn protocol, private mode (writes
  blocked, reads stay and hit server logs — D11), and the fail-soft posture.
  Served from that one source as the MCP `initialize` result's `instructions`
  field (stdio + HTTP, read fresh per connection) and as the new
  **unauthenticated `GET /primer.md`** endpoint (text/markdown — the ONLY
  unauthenticated content route, for OpenCode's remote-URL instructions
  config). Saves enforce the 2 KB cap like curator addendums. The legacy
  settings-key primer (`awareness.primer`, spec 041) and the `working_style`
  preamble are migrated into the file once at boot, then retired; the
  dashboard Settings form now edits the vault file.
- **Protocol-bearing tool descriptions for all 7 verbs** (rethink T12, D9/D12)
  — each description now carries its protocol (≤1KB each), since descriptions
  are the only teaching surface guaranteed to render in every harness:
  `recall` says "call before answering" and points long-form lookups at
  `search_references`; `remember` says fire-and-forget; `store_handoff`
  embeds the five required section headings; `list_handoffs`/`claim_handoff`
  carry the takeover chain (claims race → 409); `search_references` states
  references are deliberately NOT auto-recalled. The registry test pins the
  markers. Cleanups folded in: `remember`'s unreachable "saved as a proposal"
  branch and its stale "review queue" description claim are gone (S2), and
  the zombie `category`/`scope` wire fields left the curator's grooming
  contract (S1; `CURATOR_PROMPT_VERSION` v5.1 → v5.2 — the input-hash
  invalidation is deliberate).
- **The 7-verb registry is pinned end-to-end** (rethink T13, spec §5.1):
  `scripts/healthcheck.js` now asserts the exact agent surface — `recall`/
  `remember`/`flag_memory` + `store_handoff`/`list_handoffs`/`claim_handoff`
  + `search_references`, nothing missing, nothing extra (the retired
  `conv_state_*`/`list_skills`/`get_skill` verbs stay pinned absent) — and
  the tool-registry test pins exactly 7 with no internal/admin-only tools.
- **All five harness integrations live in-tree under `integrations/`**
  (rethink T14–T16, D9/D10/D14): `claude/` (marketplace manifest +
  env-var-templated `.mcp.json` + four command markdown files — no hooks, no
  code), `codex/` (README-only: `url` + `bearer_token_env_var` MCP config),
  `opencode/` (README-only: remote MCP block + the one-line
  `instructions: ["<server>/primer.md"]`; command files byte-identical to the
  Claude set), `hermes/` (Python `MemoryProvider` — the 7 verbs proxied over
  HTTP, primer via `system_prompt_block()`, stdlib-only at runtime, pytest
  wired into CI via `.github/workflows/hermes-tests.yml`), and `pi/`
  (`@librarian/pi-extension` in the pnpm workspace — 7 native tool proxies +
  a `before_agent_start` primer hook, with a schema-parity drift guard
  against `@librarian/mcp-server`). Per-turn injection hooks and conv-state
  machinery are gone everywhere; private mode is the in-conversation
  `[librarian:private=on|off]` marker (D11). The five standalone plugin
  repos are being archived — **AGENTS.md's rule is inverted: harness work
  happens here, never in the standalone repos.**

### Fixed — Phase 2 review

- **Hermes + Pi had mirrored a pre-T12 tool surface** (both were built in
  parallel worktrees): they advertised the retired required `category` field
  on `remember` (Pi also the zombie `visibility`/`scope` fields) plus the
  stale "protected memories route to a review queue" claim, and Pi's tool
  descriptions had drifted from the T12 protocol-bearing rewrites. Re-synced
  both (Pi descriptions are again verbatim copies of the server's; both
  `/learn` templates now tell the fire-and-forget intake story), and the
  Hermes CI workflow now also triggers on
  `packages/mcp-server/src/mcp/tools/**` so a server-side surface change
  re-runs the parity suite.
- **Hermes client error hygiene raised to the Pi client's level:** endpoints
  embedding basic-auth credentials are refused up front, and network-failure
  messages render a credential-free, query-free endpoint.
- **`docs/slash-commands.md` rewritten to the rethink contract** — in-tree
  integrations, marker-based private mode (the per-turn hook story is gone),
  `remember` as fire-and-forget intake (no protected-category proposal
  routing), no `domain` scoping. AGENTS.md §1–§2 updated to match.

### Removed — the Phase 1 carve-down

- **Whole subsystems deleted:** the skills subsystem (skill store, vault
  handling, `list_skills`/`get_skill`), the server-side `conv_state_*` tools +
  sidecar store, the namespaced recall index (recall now runs on the plain
  hybrid index built from `memories/` only), the classifier plumbing
  (`pendingClassification`/`outsideSession`/`forceActive` routing), the
  SQLite-shaped store contracts (dead `backend` discriminator, the
  category/visibility/scope columns on the tRPC memories surface), the
  event-ledger throwers (`appendEvent`/`listEvents`), the curator addendum
  under-evaluation lifecycle and grooming dry-run, and the risk-level apply
  policy (`off`/`safe_only`/`high_confidence` + `risk_level`).
- **The dual intake/grooming prompt pair** — replaced by ONE unified curator
  prompt core with mode sections (`CURATOR_PROMPT_VERSION` v5 → v5.1) and ONE
  apply rule (rethink D13): `noop` skips; `archive`/`split` ALWAYS propose; a
  `requires_approval` target or a force-proposal submission always proposes;
  `create`/`update`/`merge` auto-apply at confidence ≥ the single
  `curator.apply.confidence_threshold` knob.
- **Deleted parked proposals** `safe-fallback-capture.md`,
  `memory-healthchecks-and-benchmarks.md` and `hybrid-recall.md` — the
  still-relevant ideas were folded into `docs/TODO.md`.

### Changed

- **Deliberate behaviour reset: the curator auto-apply confidence threshold is
  0.8 for EVERY instance** (spec §15.3, owner-confirmed). The legacy
  `curator.grooming.auto_apply_confidence` / `curator.auto_apply_confidence`
  settings are no longer read (the migrate-on-read fallback is gone);
  `migrate-data-dir` reports the stale keys. If you ran a custom threshold,
  re-set the one knob — `curator.apply.confidence_threshold` — from the
  dashboard.
- **Archive proposals ride the flag-review queue, in both curator lanes.**
  Grooming and intake now FLAG the judged target memory
  (`curator proposes archive: <redacted rationale>`) instead of intake filing
  the raw submission as an unactionable proposed doc. Flagging is idempotent:
  an open curator flag is never stacked (a re-groom of an unchanged slice
  records `skipped: already flagged by curator`), and an admin-dismissed flag
  is honoured — dismissal removes the flag, so a later run may legitimately
  flag afresh, but an open dismissal decision is never silently overridden.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-12

### Removed

- **6 admin/redundant MCP verbs — the agent-facing surface is now 9 verbs.**
  Removed `start_context` (the injected primer covers it), `propose_memory`
  (subsumed by `remember`), and `archive_memory` / `approve_proposal` /
  `list_proposals` / `update_memory` (admin/curatorial — they remain on the
  dashboard tRPC and in the curator, just no longer exposed to agents). The
  agent MCP is now exactly **9 verbs** (`recall`, `remember`, `flag_memory`,
  `store_handoff`, `list_handoffs`, `claim_handoff`, `list_skills`, `get_skill`,
  `search_references`) plus the 3 internal `conv_state_*` injection tools.
  Underlying store methods + tRPC procedures are unchanged. **Breaking** for any
  agent/plugin calling a removed verb (the plugin hooks move off them in the
  coordinated plugin releases). Finalizes ADR 0006 / plan 048 PR-4.

### Changed

- **Removed the bundled "how to use The Librarian" skill** (`skills/use-the-librarian/`)
  and aligned the in-repo docs (`docs/slash-commands.md`, `.claude/commands/*`,
  `README.md`, `SOUL.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`) to the 9-verb surface. Per ADR 0006,
  the injected primer + the tools' own descriptions are the teaching surface — no
  auto-loaded skill. Surviving verb descriptions sharpened to behavioural docs.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **`list_skills` MCP verb.** A simple `list_skills()` returns the server-hosted
  skill catalog (`{ slug, name, description }[]`); pair it with `get_skill` to
  fetch a skill's full document. Replaces the skills half of the removed
  `session_manifest`.
- **Working-style preamble now rides the injected primer.** The `working_style`
  setting (previously surfaced by `session_manifest`) is appended to the
  awareness primer that `conv_state_get` injects every turn — fail-soft, so a
  missing/secret-stored value degrades to just the awareness note. (plan 048 PR-3)

### Removed

- **`find_skills` and `session_manifest` MCP verbs.** `find_skills` (ranked skill
  search) is replaced by `list_skills` for the now-small catalog — the ranking
  helper stays in core, re-introducible later. `session_manifest` is split:
  skills → `list_skills`, working-style → the injected primer (above). Both are
  added to the healthcheck's retired-tools guard.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Dashboard: a "Flagged" review queue for `flag_memory`.** A new **Flagged**
  nav tab + page lists every memory with an open flag, showing each flag's
  reason, the flagging agent, and when — with per-row **Dismiss** (clear the
  flags, keep the memory active) and **Archive** (archive + clear) actions.
  Backed by two admin-only tRPC procedures, `memories.listFlagged` and
  `memories.resolveFlag`. This is the human/curator adjudication surface for the
  route-to-review flags introduced in 0.8.0 (plan 048 PR-2).

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **`flag_memory(memory_id, reason)` MCP verb.** An agent can flag a recalled
  memory it believes is incorrect, misleading, or outdated, with a short
  free-text `reason`. The flag is **route-to-review**: it appends to a `flags`
  list in the memory's frontmatter (the same storage method `proposed` uses — no
  separate ledger), leaves the memory `active`, and **soft-demotes** it in recall
  (ranked below unflagged matches, never excluded) until a human/curator
  adjudicates. The flagger is the authenticated caller (a contradicting
  client-supplied `agent_id` is rejected); an empty or oversized `reason` is
  refused. Implements the first slice of the agent-facing MCP surface redesign
  (ADR 0006).

### Removed

- **`verify_memory` MCP verb (replaced by `flag_memory`).** The gameable
  `useful`/`not_useful`/`outdated` signal — and its agent-driven *immediate
  archive* (`outdated`) — are gone. There is no "this memory was correct" signal;
  recall leans on passive usage + the new flag demotion. A tool-registry contract
  test now pins the agent-facing surface against accidental drift.

## [0.7.4] — 2026-06-11

### Changed

- **ADR 0006 — agent-facing MCP surface (accepted).** A decision record only (no
  code change): slims the MCP from 19 tools to **9 agent verbs** (`recall`,
  `remember`, `flag_memory`, the handoff trio, `list_skills`, `get_skill`,
  `search_references`), replacing `verify_memory` with a route-to-review
  `flag_memory(memory_id, reason)`, relocating `conv_state_*` off the agent tool
  surface (deferred follow-on), and keeping all admin/curatorial operations on
  tRPC/in-process. **Accepted** — Spec 047 + Plan 048 approved; implementation
  underway as a coordinated cross-repo change. See
  `docs/adr/0006-agent-facing-mcp-surface.md`.

## [0.7.3] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Brand watermark behind the dashboard.** A large, faint Librarian mark is
  fixed and centred behind every page's content (decorative — `aria-hidden`,
  `pointer-events-none`, `-z-10`, so it never intercepts clicks). The small nav
  logo stays. It's the light (dark-ink) variant, subtle on the default light
  theme and near-invisible on dark.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Logo in the top nav.** The Librarian mark
  (`assets/logo/the-librarian-mark-vector-light.svg`) now sits at the start of
  the persistent top navigation, linking home. The web copy lives in
  `apps/dashboard/public/`. It's the light (dark-ink) variant, suited to the
  default light theme; a dark-theme variant can be swapped in via a `dark:` rule
  once one exists.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Dashboard favicons + PWA manifest.** Wired the full icon set
  (`assets/icons/`) into the dashboard: SVG + sized PNG favicons, the
  `apple-touch-icon`, the Windows tile, and `site.webmanifest` (installable PWA
  with the brand theme colour `#061B22`). The web set lives in
  `apps/dashboard/public/`; the masters stay in `assets/icons/`. Previously the
  dashboard shipped no favicon at all.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Memories page: select-all / deselect-all.** A select-all control sits above
  the row checkboxes and toggles every memory on the current page in one click
  (showing an indeterminate state for a partial selection), so a whole page can
  be fed to the bulk re-home flow without ticking each row.
- **Archive page: checkboxes + permanently delete archived memories.** The
  Archive page now has per-row checkboxes, a select-all control, and a
  **Permanently delete (N)** action. Deletion is gated behind a confirmation
  modal that lists the selected memories and warns it can't be undone from the
  app. Backed by a new admin-only `memories.purge` tRPC mutation and a
  `purgeMemory` store primitive that **hard-deletes the vault document** (the
  narrow exception to "archive = move, never destroy"); the disposable index
  drops the row on rebuild. Guarded to **archived-only** — an active or proposed
  memory must be archived first, so a one-click delete can never hit a live
  memory. Each purge is a git commit, so a deletion remains recoverable from
  history by an admin even though it's gone from the app, recall, and the index.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Release runbook slimmed to the automated model.** Now that all five plugin
  repos (Claude, Codex, Hermes, OpenCode, Pi) have the same release-on-merge
  workflow + `release-guard` as the monorepo, `docs/release-runbook.md` drops the
  per-plugin manual `git tag` / `gh release` / `npm publish` command blocks and
  the "⏳ migrating" labels. It now documents one unified flow — bump the version
  file(s) + a dated CHANGELOG entry in your PR; the merge tags, releases, and (for
  the npm packages) publishes automatically — plus a per-repo version-file +
  user-update table. Docs only.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-06-08

### Changed

- **Release process: merging to `main` is now the release — no more
  `[Unreleased]`.** Every PR bumps the root `package.json` and files its notes
  under a dated `## [X.Y.Z]` heading in the same PR; the CHANGELOG no longer
  carries an `[Unreleased]` section. A new **Release** workflow
  (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) auto-creates the `vX.Y.Z` git tag + GitHub
  release on the version-bumping merge to `main`, and a `check:release` CI guard
  fails any PR that leaves an `[Unreleased]` section, forgets the version bump,
  or desyncs `package.json` from the top CHANGELOG entry. `AGENTS.md`,
  `docs/release.md`, and `docs/release-runbook.md` are updated to the new model;
  the old separate-release-branch flow is retired. No runtime behaviour change.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **Curator dashboard: editable cadences + clear run-now reasons.** The Curator
  page now exposes both job schedules as editable controls — Intake shows *Run
  every [N] minutes* and Grooming shows *Run every [N] days at [HH:MM]* (with a
  *1 = nightly · 7 = weekly · 30 ≈ monthly* hint) — saved over the existing
  admin tRPC config surface and taking effect on the next poll (no restart).
  Both controls validate client-side (whole number ≥ 1) and surface the server's
  teaching error inline when a value is rejected. **Run now** no longer fails
  silently: when a run does nothing it reports a clear reason — *automatic runs
  are disabled (Run now still works)*, *no model configured*, *no LLM token
  configured*, or *nothing to do* — instead of a bare no-op. The enable toggles
  are unchanged.

- **Configurable intake sweep interval — `curator.intake.interval_minutes`.**
  The intake (consolidator) job's inbox-sweep cadence is now a setting — *run
  every N minutes* (positive integer, **default 5**) — replacing the hard-coded
  poll interval. Validated (`interval_minutes must be an integer >= 1`) and read
  without the master key (the cockpit render path). The scheduler wiring +
  dashboard control land in follow-up tasks.

- **Configurable grooming schedule — `curator.grooming.interval_days` +
  `curator.grooming.schedule_time`.** The grooming curator now reads a
  wall-clock cadence — *run every N days at HH:MM* (server-local time), default
  *every 1 day at 03:00* (nightly at 3 AM; 7 = weekly, ~30 = monthly). The
  auto-apply policy keys move under the job namespace too
  (`curator.default_auto_apply` → `curator.grooming.default_auto_apply`,
  `curator.auto_apply_confidence` → `curator.grooming.auto_apply_confidence`).
  A seed-once, no-clobber migration carries an existing install's settings into
  the new keys (the legacy `curator.schedule.{time,interval_days}` and the
  un-prefixed policy keys map 1:1), so behaviour is preserved across the
  upgrade. Both new settings are validated (`interval_days` integer ≥ 1;
  `schedule_time` 24h `HH:MM`) and settable via the `curator.setConfig` admin
  API. (Scheduler wiring + dashboard controls land in follow-up tasks.)

- **Configurable grooming run size — `curator.grooming.max_memories`.** The
  grooming curator now reads a per-run cap on how many active+proposed memories
  a single run feeds the model, wired through the tick into every run's evidence
  gather and settable via the `curator.setConfig` admin API. This bounds a run
  so one oversized slice can't exceed the LLM timeout — the cause of a
  production incident where a ~60-memory global slice failed every scheduled run
  with `llm_timeout` (a slow model couldn't process the whole slice in 60s, and
  the failed slice re-ran forever). **Default 200** (the prior implicit cap), so
  existing installs are unchanged; lower it for slow models / large slices.
  Truncation is newest-first, so a cap below the slice size leaves the oldest
  memories ungroomed until they next change — an informed trade-off documented
  in [ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-bounded-grooming-runs.md), with automatic
  full-coverage bounding (chunking / rotation) proposed as the follow-up.

### Changed

- **Internal naming aligned to the Intake / Grooming / Curator vocabulary
  (code-symbol rename only — no behaviour change).** Job-named code symbols,
  files, and the eval package were renamed so the codebase reads the way the
  product talks: `consolidator` → `intake` everywhere it named a code identifier
  (including the `@librarian/consolidator-eval` package → `@librarian/intake-eval`
  and its `consolidator-eval` bin → `intake-eval`), and the **grooming-sense** of
  `curator` → `grooming` (e.g. `runCuratorTick` → `runGroomingTick`,
  `CuratorConfig` → `GroomingConfig`, the dashboard `CuratorConfigForm` /
  `CuratorRunsTable` / `CuratorChatWorkspace` and their actions → `Grooming*`).
  **"Curator" is retained as the umbrella** for the two jobs — the dashboard
  "Memory Curator" page + `/curator` route, the `curator.<job>.*` settings
  namespace, the `curator_note` field, and the `Curation*` projection are
  deliberately unchanged. Persisted provenance kept stable for compatibility:
  the `system-consolidator` actor-id values and the `LIBRARIAN_CONSOLIDATOR*`
  env-var names are untouched; only the opaque `curator_note.source` writer
  flips from `"consolidator"` to `"intake"` on newly-filed memories. A CI
  `check:naming-canon` guard now fails the build if a job is renamed back to
  `consolidator`/`curator`. No runtime behaviour changes.

- **Enabling/disabling a curator job — and changing its cadence — now takes
  effect on the next poll, with no server restart.** The Intake and Grooming
  schedulers are now created **unconditionally** at boot (whenever their poll
  interval is > 0), mirroring the backup scheduler; each tick **self-gates** on
  its dashboard toggle (`curator.intake.enabled` / `curator.grooming.enabled`),
  so a disabled job is a cheap no-op and flipping the toggle starts (or stops)
  the work on the next tick. Previously the schedulers were only created when the
  job was enabled at boot, so a toggle required a restart to take effect.
  - The **Intake sweep cadence is now runtime-effective**: the scheduler polls on
    a fixed short floor (`LIBRARIAN_CONSOLIDATOR_TICK_MS`, default **60s**) and
    sweeps only once `curator.intake.interval_minutes` have elapsed since the last
    sweep, so editing the interval changes the effective sweep gap on the next
    poll — no restart. The effective gap is `max(interval_minutes, poll-floor)`.
  - The **Grooming schedule** runs on its own poll (`LIBRARIAN_GROOMING_TICK_MS`
    — *not* the retired `LIBRARIAN_CURATOR_TICK_MS`; default **15 min**) calling
    the scheduled-grooming entry, which checks the wall-clock schedule
    (`curator.grooming.{interval_days,schedule_time}`) and runs a pass when due —
    so editing the schedule also takes effect without a restart. This
    **re-introduces a wall-clock grooming schedule that 0.5.0 had removed** (0.5.0
    retired the wall-clock cron and made grooming intake-triggered only); the
    schedule now runs alongside that trigger.
  - The boot banner now reports each job's **live** enable state as two distinct
    jobs (`intake: on|off`, `grooming: on|off`) read at log time.
  - Legacy `curator.schedule.*` keys are **migrated** into the
    `curator.grooming.*` schedule at boot before the legacy-key notice; that
    notice no longer says the keys are "ignored" — it confirms they were migrated
    and can be deleted.

- **Grooming no longer skips recently-groomed slices on a pass — the per-slice
  time-interval gate is retired.** A scheduled or run-now grooming pass now
  attempts **every** slice; the existing content **input-hash idempotency**
  (a slice whose evidence is unchanged since its last completed apply-run makes
  **no LLM call**) is the sole gate deciding which slices actually do work.
  Previously a per-slice "every N minutes" interval gate (`curator.interval_minutes`,
  default 60) could skip a slice that had groomed within the last hour even on a
  forced pass. Net effect: a pass re-grooms only the slices whose content has
  changed (a `bypassSkip` run-now still re-runs everything), and the schedule
  (every N days at HH:MM) — not a per-slice timer — decides *when* a pass runs.
  This fully retires the vestigial `curator.interval_minutes` cadence setting and
  removes the per-slice interval control from the Curator config form. (The legacy
  key is still read once by the enablement migration to seed the auto-groom
  debounce floor, `curator.grooming.debounce_minutes` — that is unchanged.)

- **Admin "Run now" works on a disabled job (behaviour change).** Clicking *Run
  now* on the Intake or Grooming job in the cockpit now runs a one-off pass even
  when that job is **disabled** — an explicit admin override. Previously both
  run-now controls refused a disabled job (intake returned
  `{ran:false,reason:"disabled"}`; grooming self-gated on `curator.enabled`
  before running), so an operator had to enable a job just to test it. The
  enable gate is now bypassed only on the run-now path (the scheduled tick still
  does nothing when a job is disabled). The LLM-config/token gates still apply —
  a disabled-but-unconfigured job returns a clear `incomplete_config` / `no_token`
  reason (never `disabled`) for the cockpit to display.

### Fixed

- **The grooming/intake boot scan now respects the timer-off switch
  (`*_TICK_MS=0`) — disabling a job's poll timer disables its automatic curation
  entirely.** Each job kicks one pass at boot (before the first poll fires), but
  that boot scan is now **gated on the job's scheduler being live**: setting
  `LIBRARIAN_GROOMING_TICK_MS=0` (or `LIBRARIAN_CONSOLIDATOR_TICK_MS=0`) now means
  *no automatic grooming/intake at all* — not "no timer, but still one pass on
  every restart". Previously the boot scan ran unconditionally, so a server with
  the grooming timer off still groomed the whole corpus at each startup. Run-now
  and the dry-run / re-evaluate admin paths bypass the schedulers and are
  unaffected. (Surfaced as a test-determinism regression: a boot-time grooming
  pass was auto-applying/proposing into a freshly-seeded corpus before a dry-run
  or re-evaluate could act on it.)

- **`propose_memory` now goes through the curator instead of writing around it.**
  Previously `propose_memory` wrote a standalone proposal directly — bypassing the
  inbox, so it got **no dedup or merge** (an obvious restatement of an existing
  memory became a duplicate proposal, and on approval a duplicate active memory),
  and it slipped past the under-evaluation gate that holds an unproven curator
  prompt's output for review. It now **submits to the consolidator inbox with a
  force-proposal directive** (when intake is enabled): the curator dedups and
  merges it like any submission, but it **always terminates as a proposal**, never
  an auto-apply. The proposal therefore lands after the next consolidator tick
  (the tool now replies "queued for review") rather than synchronously. When
  intake is off, the legacy direct write remains — but now **surfaces detected
  duplicates** in its response, matching `remember`. See
  [ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-propose-memory-routes-through-inbox.md).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Awareness primer — a dashboard-editable note that tells every agent it has
  durable memory.** A new admin setting (**Settings → Awareness primer**) holds a
  short, server-sourced note (shipped with a sensible default, pre-filled) that
  will be injected **every turn on every harness** — reminding the model that The
  Librarian exists and which verbs to reach for (`recall` before asking,
  `remember` / `/learn` to save). Editing it changes what the next turn sees with
  no plugin redeploy; **clearing it to empty disables the primer**. The server now
  returns the primer as an **additive `primer` field on every `conv_state_get`
  response** — both when a conversation-state row exists (alongside the existing
  row fields, so un-updated plugins are unaffected) and when none does — so it is
  available on the very first turn and on harnesses without a stable conversation
  id; reads are fail-soft (`""` on an unreadable settings store, never blocking a
  turn). Per-turn injection of the `<librarian>` block reaches each harness as its
  plugin adopts the new field (rolling out incrementally, backward-compatibly).

- **The curator now self-improves under your supervision.** You can teach each
  curator job — **Intake** and **Grooming** — by editing its **prompt addendum**,
  a per-job vault file (`<vault>/.curator/grooming-addendum.md` and
  `intake-addendum.md`) that is **git-versioned**, so every edit gets diff,
  revert, and backup for free; an existing install's old single
  `curator.prompt_addendum` is migrated into the grooming file byte-for-byte and
  retired automatically. **Both jobs now consume their addendum on the live
  path** (intake previously didn't). Editing an addendum puts that job **under
  evaluation**: every operation it would have auto-applied is instead **proposed**
  for your review (auto-archives are skipped), tagged with the addendum version,
  until you **Accept** (resume auto-apply), **Roll back** (`git checkout` the
  prior version), or — for grooming — **Re-evaluate** that version's proposals.
  Grooming can also **dry-run** a candidate addendum over the whole corpus or a
  single slice in propose-mode **without committing it live**. A new **curator
  chat** (a "discuss this memory" button on each memory row plus a general entry)
  grounds in a memory and its decision history and can **propose** a fix-now
  mutation — **merge / split / update / unmerge** (unmerge reverses a bad groom)
  — or an addendum edit, which **you confirm** with an explicit button: the
  curator proposes, never executes on its own. There is **no automated evaluation
  gate** — the addendum is **advisory** (the curator's hard, safety, and
  structural rules stay code-re-checked regardless of it), and the guards are a
  human judging real results, a 2 KB addendum cap (soft in-chat condense + hard
  write backstop), the under-evaluation lifecycle, and dry-run. Everything is
  **admin-only** — there is no agent-facing surface and recall/navigate are
  untouched.

- **Unified Memory Curator dashboard — one page, two jobs.** The Memory Curator
  page now presents both curator jobs side by side in clear **Intake** and
  **Grooming** sections, each with its own enablement toggle, model
  configuration, recent-run history, and a run-now button. Shared LLM provider
  management lives once, above both sections (it serves both jobs). The Intake
  section makes consolidation **observable for the first time**: each run expands
  to reveal its decisions — the action taken, whether it was applied, proposed,
  skipped, or failed, the confidence, and the rationale — so you can see exactly
  what intake did with each new submission. Run-now clearly reports when nothing
  ran and why (disabled / incomplete config / no token). Everything stays
  admin-only.

- **Intake can now propose splitting an overloaded memory at ingestion.** When a
  new submission turns out to be primarily about a different, already
  well-supported entity whose existing doc has become an overloaded grab-bag, the
  intake judge can now propose a **split** — spinning that conflated doc into
  focused per-entity docs. An intake split is **always a proposal for you to
  approve, never applied automatically** (even at high confidence): intake lacks
  grooming's whole-corpus context, so a human decides every split. The scope is
  deliberately narrow to avoid over-fragmentation — a single-entity or
  non-overloaded submission never splits, and the split target must be one of the
  memories intake already retrieved as a candidate. (Grooming's existing split is
  unchanged; both now share one underlying mechanism.)

- **Dashboard-managed LLM providers with independent per-consumer model
  selection.** The curator's LLM connection is no longer a single hard-coded
  block — you now manage named LLM providers (name + endpoint + write-only API
  token) on the Memory Curator page, and the two curator consumers, **intake**
  (inbox consolidation) and **grooming** (memory curation), each pick their own
  provider *and* model independently, so they can run on different models (and
  providers) while reusing one stored connection. The model field offers a probed
  dropdown of the provider's available models with a free-text fallback, and a
  "Test connection" check (tokens are sent only as a `Bearer` header, never echoed
  back). Existing installs are migrated automatically on the first curator/
  consolidator run: the old single `curator.llm.*` config is converted one-time
  into a `default` provider that both consumers point at, then the legacy config
  is retired. The migration is fail-soft — if the master key is temporarily
  unavailable it defers and retries on a later run, never losing your token.

### Changed

- **The curator's prompt addendum is now a git-versioned vault file.** Each
  curator job's advisory prompt addendum moves out of a single overwritten
  setting into a committed vault file (`<vault>/.curator/grooming-addendum.md`,
  and `intake-addendum.md` for intake), so edits get git history, diff, and
  revert for free. An existing install's `curator.prompt_addendum` is migrated
  into the grooming file **byte-for-byte automatically on first start** and the
  old setting is retired — no operator action needed. (Editing these files, the
  under-evaluation lifecycle, dry-run, and the curator chat are described under
  the self-improving-curator entry in **Added** above.)

- **Consistent "one curator, two jobs" naming across the product.** User-facing
  surfaces now describe a single curator doing two jobs — **Intake** (consolidates
  new submissions) and **Grooming** (tends the existing corpus) — rather than
  exposing the older internal "consolidator" name. The dashboard model labels,
  the `remember` queued-for-consolidation reply, the agent skill doc, and the
  README curator section are updated to match. No behaviour change.

- **Both curator jobs' enablement is now a dashboard setting; the
  `LIBRARIAN_CONSOLIDATOR` env var is deprecated.** Grooming and intake are now
  enabled/disabled from settings under the unified `curator.*` namespace
  (`curator.grooming.enabled` / `curator.intake.enabled`) instead of the old
  `curator.enabled` setting (grooming) and the `LIBRARIAN_CONSOLIDATOR`
  environment variable (intake). Existing installs are migrated automatically on
  the first boot — your exact enablement is preserved (grooming-on stays on,
  `LIBRARIAN_CONSOLIDATOR=on` becomes intake-on) — and the migration is
  idempotent and never overwrites a value you have since set. The setting is now
  authoritative: `LIBRARIAN_CONSOLIDATOR` no longer controls intake (it only
  seeds the setting once), so toggling intake from the dashboard takes effect.
  **Action:** remove `LIBRARIAN_CONSOLIDATOR` from your environment — it logs a
  deprecation warning on boot while still set, and will be removed in a future
  release. (`LIBRARIAN_CONSOLIDATOR_TICK_MS`, the tick cadence, is unaffected.)

- **Grooming no longer runs on a wall-clock cron — it is triggered.** Memory
  grooming (curation) previously ran on a timer; it now runs only when you click
  **Run now** or when intake has changed enough memories to warrant it. After an
  intake sweep, if intake has created/augmented/superseded at least
  `curator.grooming.trigger_threshold` memories (default 20) since the last groom,
  one grooming run is enqueued — rate-limited so it never auto-runs within
  `curator.grooming.debounce_minutes` (default 60, seeded once from your old
  `curator.interval_minutes`) of the previous one. Due-slice idempotency is
  unchanged, so a triggered groom still only reprocesses slices whose input
  actually changed. The wall-clock cron (`LIBRARIAN_CURATOR_TICK_MS`) is retired.

### Removed

- **Dashboard `/logs` and `/recall` pages removed.** Both rendered the
  append-only event ledger, which is retired on the markdown backend, so both
  were permanently empty. Live recall already lives on the Memories page; the
  audit trail lives in git history. The backing `memories.events` /
  `memories.byIds` tRPC procedures and the always-empty "By category" / "By
  scope" analytics dimensions are dropped with them.

- **The SQLite storage backend is gone — markdown is the only backend.** The
  `node:sqlite` event-ledger store, its projection/replay layer, and the
  `LIBRARIAN_BACKEND` / `resolveBackend` / `StorageBackend` selector are removed;
  `createLibrarianStore` now always returns the git-vault markdown store. Memory,
  curation, settings, conversation-state, and handoff data live in the vault (+
  sidecar JSON for non-memory state), exactly as the shipped product already
  defaulted to. The append-only event ledger is retired (git history is the audit
  trail), so the now-empty `BACKUP_REQUIRES_MARKDOWN` error export and the
  SQLite-era `memory.classified` / `classifier.evaluation_completed` event schemas
  are dropped. The `check:no-store-bypass` CI guard (which sealed the
  SQLite-handle seam) is retired with the seam it guarded.

- **The retired event-ledger schema layer is gone.** With the event ledger
  retired on the markdown backend (git history is the audit trail), the
  `MemoryLedgerEntry` discriminated union and its 14 member schemas
  (`MemoryCreated`/`Proposed`/`Updated`/`Approved`/`Rejected`/`Deleted`/
  `Archived`/`Recalled`/`RecallEmpty`/`Verified`/`UsefulnessAdjusted`/
  `BulkUpdated`/`ConflictDetected`/`ConflictResolved`), plus the `MemoryEventType`
  enum and `MemoryEventTypeSchema`, had no remaining producer or consumer and are
  removed from `@librarian/core`. The runtime `MemoryEvent` store type (a plain
  `event_type: string`) is unaffected.

### Changed

- **Proposals screen shows full memory text.** The Proposals review list no longer
  clamps a proposed memory's body to two lines — it renders the full body with
  preserved line breaks, so a proposal can be read and judged without opening it
  elsewhere. The Archive list keeps its two-line preview (the new `expandBody` prop
  on `SimpleMemoryList` defaults to the clamped behaviour).

- **`backup.github.repo` is validated as an `owner/repo` slug at the config
  boundary.** A malformed value (a bare repo name, a full URL, junk) used to fail
  deep in the `git push` with a confusing message; the dashboard `backup.setConfig`
  procedure now rejects it up front with a teaching error that shows the expected
  shape and echoes the bad value (e.g. `Expected "owner/repo" (e.g.
  "octocat/hello-world"), got "hello-world"`), never any token. An empty/unset repo
  stays allowed.

- **Agent guidance: the curator owns consolidation.** The `use-the-librarian`
  skill no longer tells agents to recall/search for duplicates before
  `remember`, or to hand-consolidate via `update` + `verify(outdated)` — the
  consolidator/curator de-duplicates, merges, and supersedes asynchronously
  (with the consolidator on, `remember` is fire-and-forget and returns no
  `duplicates` list). The `/learn` command drops its stale `conv_id`→`domain`
  resolution and "classifier worker" references. Docs accuracy: README drops the
  retired `domain` handoff scope, the removed `/logs` + `/recall` dashboard tabs,
  and the stale "JSONL ledgers + SQLite/FTS5 index" storage line (it's a
  git-backed markdown vault now); the skill's storage example is updated to match.
  (The harness plugin repos carry the same agent-guidance fix.)

- **The per-turn `<conversation-state>` block is trimmed to `conv_id` +
  `off_record`.** D16 had already removed the `domain` line from the canonical
  renderer; the `session_id` line is now dropped too — the session lifecycle that
  populated it is retired, so it was always `none`. `off_record` (the privacy
  signal) and `conv_id` (the key) remain. The five harness plugins, which mirror
  this block byte-for-byte, are updated in lockstep.

- **Backup is now `git push` of the memory vault.** On the markdown backend the
  old backup bundled an empty `librarian.sqlite` (memories live in the git vault,
  not SQLite) — so it backed up almost nothing. Backup now pushes the vault repo
  to a GitHub remote built from the `backup.github.{repo,token}` settings, and a
  restore is a `git clone`. The token is supplied to git via a `GIT_ASKPASS`
  helper, so it never appears in the remote URL, `.git/config`, the process
  command line, or git's error output. The v0.4.0 `VACUUM INTO` / gzip-bundle /
  checksummed-manifest / staged-restart-restore machinery, the **S3 target**, and
  bundle retention are retired (git history is the retention). Backup run history
  moved to a sidecar `backup-runs.json`. The dashboard `/backups` page now
  configures the GitHub remote + schedule; the CLI `the-librarian backup` pushes
  the vault. A new `check:no-secrets-in-vault` CI guard asserts secrets never land
  in the pushed vault. **Secrets are not auto-backed-up** — save your
  `LIBRARIAN_SECRET_KEY` (shown once on first boot); other settings are
  re-enterable via the dashboard. **Restore** clones the backup repo into a staging
  dir, then swaps it in on the next restart (never under the live store), keeping
  your current vault as `vault.pre-restore.bak` — available from the dashboard
  `/backups` page (validate-before-swap, restart-gated, reversible) and applied at
  boot before the store opens.

- **Consolidator curation prompt → v3.** Two additions to the judge's "ways of
  working": (1) **title-craft** — write a concise, entity-first noun phrase (the
  title is also the memory's filename now), avoiding category prefixes, colons, and
  sentence/status-style titles; (2) a **gatekeeping bias** — `noop` (discard)
  submissions that are obviously transient or low-value (one-off task notes,
  resolved bugs/typos, ephemeral status) rather than cluttering the library, while
  still filing anything of genuinely unclear value. `CONSOLIDATOR_PROMPT_VERSION`
  bumped v2 → v3.

- **Memory files now have human-readable names.** A memory is written to
  `memories/<title-slug>-<shortid>.md` (e.g. `role-and-responsibilities-2dd76e5c.md`)
  instead of `memories/<id>.md` — far easier to browse, diff, and maintain by hand.
  The id suffix keeps names unique; the filename is set once at creation and never
  renamed (the frontmatter id + title stay authoritative). The store now resolves a
  memory's file by its frontmatter id, so existing `<id>.md` files keep working
  unchanged — no migration needed.

### Fixed

- **Recall no longer embeds references it never queries.** The recall index built
  both the corpus (memories) and the references tier eagerly, but `recall` only
  ever queries the corpus — references are searched through the separate
  `search_references` path. Embedding every reference on each index build was pure
  waste, and brutal when references are large (a single 553 KB reference is a ~10s
  embed under the real model, so a groom over a reference-heavy vault stalled for
  minutes before processing a single memory). References are now embedded lazily —
  only when `search_references` is actually called. (`search_references`'s own
  per-call cost is tracked separately in docs/TODO.md.)

- **The vault always gets its own git repo, even when nested in another checkout.**
  The store inits the vault as a git repo (a commit per write), but the init guard
  treated "inside *any* repo" as done — so a data dir placed under an existing git
  checkout skipped init and committed every memory write into that *parent* repo
  (running `git add -A` over its whole working tree). The guard now checks whether
  the vault is its own repo *root*, creating a dedicated repo when nested. A
  standalone/Docker `./data` was unaffected; this only bit vaults under a checkout.

- **Recall no longer re-embeds the whole corpus on every write.** The disposable
  recall index is rebuilt (and every active memory re-embedded) whenever a memory
  is written; a bulk groom — consolidating many inbox items one at a time — did
  that once per item over a growing corpus, i.e. O(N²) embeddings. Under the real
  CPU model (EmbeddingGemma) that made a large groom (e.g. a seed import of a few
  hundred memories) glacial. The store now memoizes document embeddings by content
  across rebuilds, so each distinct memory embeds once per sweep (O(N)); queries
  are never cached.

- **Recall no longer crashes on long documents.** EmbeddingGemma threw "Input is
  longer than the context size" on any doc over its ~2048-token window, failing
  the consolidator's navigate step for that item. Long inputs are now truncated to
  the model's context window before embedding (a truncated embedding still
  captures the gist for recall).

### Changed

- **Consolidator curation prompt → v2.** The judge prompt now states the
  *judgement* behind a filing choice, not just the output contract: preserve over
  rewrite (augment rather than supersede unless genuinely contradicted), calibrate
  confidence honestly so an ambiguous-entity merge scores low (and files fresh
  rather than clobbering the wrong target), resolve entities cautiously, and file
  for retrieval (`[[wikilink]]` both sides of a multi-entity fact). Affects only
  the opt-in consolidator; `CONSOLIDATOR_PROMPT_VERSION` bumped v1 → v2.

- **The shipped server + CLI now default to the markdown backend** (the plan-036
  cutover): the git-backed vault for memories/handoffs, sidecar JSON for
  conv-state/settings, the disposable hybrid index for recall. `LIBRARIAN_BACKEND=sqlite`
  is the explicit opt-out. The Docker images now include `git` (the markdown
  backend commits every write). A residual SQLite db still backs the dormant
  curator until Phase 4. **Upgrading:** existing data in `librarian.sqlite` is
  NOT auto-migrated to the vault yet (the migration tool is a follow-up) — an
  upgraded install defaults to an empty markdown vault; set `LIBRARIAN_BACKEND=sqlite`
  to keep using your existing data until migration lands.

### Added

- **`@librarian/consolidator-eval` — the consolidator evaluation harness.** An
  operator-driven package (mirroring `@librarian/classifier-eval`) that scores the
  consolidator's `navigate → judge → route` pipeline against S1/S2/S4/S12/S18
  fixtures: filing accuracy, decision-band routing, no-clobber of hand-authored
  prose (S18), contradiction-recall (S4), and entity-resolution under ambiguity
  (S12). Ships a `consolidator-eval` CLI with a frozen-baseline regression gate
  (`--update-baseline` / `--baseline … --gate`). Not part of CI (it calls a real
  model); its own tests drive the pipeline with a deterministic scripted model.

- **The consolidator — opt-in async memory filing (plan-036 Phase 4).** With
  `LIBRARIAN_CONSOLIDATOR=on` on the markdown backend, `remember` becomes a
  fire-and-forget submission: the note is queued to a vault inbox and an LLM
  consolidator files it asynchronously (navigate the existing memories → judge
  whether to augment/supersede an existing one or create a new memory →
  minimal-edit in place, preferring `[[wikilinks]]` over duplication), carrying
  the submitter's `agent_id`/`project_key`/`tags`/`applies_to`. A serial scheduler drains the
  inbox on a cadence (`LIBRARIAN_CONSOLIDATOR_TICK_MS`, default 5 min) plus a
  boot scan; it shares the curator's LLM brain config. **Default off** — when
  disabled (or on the sqlite backend, which has no vault inbox), `remember` keeps
  its existing direct-write behaviour unchanged.

- **EmbeddingGemma wired as the production embedder** for index recall +
  `search_references` (`resolveEmbedder`). Selection is env-driven:
  `LIBRARIAN_EMBEDDER=hash|llama` (default: hash under tests, the EmbeddingGemma
  model otherwise). The GGUF (`EmbeddingGemma-300M-Q8_0`, ~333 MB) is downloaded
  + cached lazily on first embed under `<dataDir>/models`, or supply your own via
  `LIBRARIAN_MODEL_PATH`. The model loads only on first use, so nothing downloads
  during boot/healthcheck.

- **`search_references` MCP tool (F3/F4).** Tier-0 lookup over the vault's
  `references/` — background reference docs that are deliberately kept out of
  normal recall. Returns each match's path + the query-relevant section (so the
  agent pulls just the matched section, not the whole file). Backed by the
  disposable hybrid index; backend-independent (references live in the vault).

- **Real embedding model via `node-llama-cpp` (F2).** `createLlamaEmbedder` runs a
  GGUF embedding model on CPU (default **EmbeddingGemma-300M**, 768-dim, multilingual)
  behind the pluggable `Embedder` interface, with asymmetric query/document prompts
  (`embedQuery`). It's lazy-loaded, so the bundled deterministic hash embedder stays
  the zero-dependency default for tests/CI and nothing loads the native binary until
  the model is actually used. The GPU (CUDA/Vulkan) prebuilt binaries are stripped at
  install via `.pnpmfile.cjs`, keeping the dependency footprint ~60 MB.

- **Skills (read surface) — `find_skills`, `get_skill` MCP tools (F7).** Skills live
  as `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` (+ optional `resources/`) in the vault; `find_skills`
  ranks the manifest (name + description) against a query, and `get_skill` returns a
  skill's full document plus its resource file list. Backend-independent (vault-based),
  fail-soft on bad input. Semantic ranking currently uses the bundled deterministic
  embedder; the production model is a drop-in via the same interface.
- **`session_manifest` MCP tool (F6, server side).** Returns the session-start
  manifest the client hook consumes: the working-style preamble (from the
  `working_style` setting) plus a bounded skills manifest.

### Changed

- **`recall` is no longer domain-scoped (D16, memory side).** Results rank by
  relevance across all memories instead of being filtered to the caller's
  conversation domain; the `conv_id` and `include_other_domains` arguments are
  removed from `recall`, and `remember` no longer derives or routes writes by
  domain. This is the first step of removing memory-domain-isolation entirely
  ("relevance from retrieval, not walls"); the `domains` management surface,
  handoff/conv-state scoping, and the SQLite domain columns are removed in
  follow-up D16 PRs.
- **Handoffs are no longer domain-scoped (D16).** `store_handoff` / `list_handoffs` /
  `claim_handoff` and the dashboard + CLI handoff views drop the per-domain isolation
  and the `conv_id` / `domain` arguments; the shared `domain-resolution` helper is
  removed. (The vestigial `handoffs.domain` column is dropped with the rest of the
  schema in the final D16 PR.)
- **The domain model is fully removed (D16, final step).** The owner-managed
  `/domains` dashboard page (and its tRPC `domains` router) is gone; conversation
  state no longer carries a `domain` (the `conv_state_upsert` tool and the per-turn
  `<conversation-state>` block drop the field, and first-create now requires only
  `harness`). The SQLite schema drops the `domains` / `signal_rules` /
  `token_domain_bindings` tables and the `domain` column from `memories`,
  `conversation_state`, and `handoffs` (projection schema version 21); existing
  databases migrate automatically on next open. Relevance now comes from retrieval,
  not domain walls.
- **`handoffs show --json` now emits the normalized handoff shape.** The CLI
  `the-librarian handoffs show --json` output uses `handoff_id` / `tags` (array) /
  `claimed_by` (object) instead of the raw database columns (`id` / `tags_json` /
  `claimed_by_json`). This falls out of routing the dashboard `handoffs.byId` view
  and the CLI through a new `HandoffStore.getById` rather than raw SQL — the first
  step of sealing the storage seam (F0) for the markdown rearchitecture.
- **`the-librarian rebuild` output is backend-neutral.** The command now reports
  "Rebuilt the memory index in &lt;data-dir&gt;" (was "Rebuilt projection from
  &lt;events.jsonl path&gt;"), and its help line reads "Rebuild the memory index from
  stored data". Same behaviour; the wording no longer names the SQLite/events-ledger
  internals, via a new backend-neutral `reindex()` store verb (F0).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Backups cockpit on the dashboard.** The `/backups` page now manages the whole
  backup lifecycle: a config form (cloud target — S3 or GitHub — with write-only
  credentials, schedule, retention, and an optional failure webhook), a health
  banner (last successful backup / last failure), the recent bundles with one-click
  **restore** (restart-staged, with the supervisor warning), and a run-history
  table. No redeploy needed to change any of it.

- **Restore a backup from the dashboard (restart-staged).** Staging a restore
  validates the chosen bundle (pulling it from the cloud target if it isn't
  local) and queues it; it's applied on the next server boot — before the SQLite
  file is opened, never under a live connection. A failed restore leaves the live
  data untouched and keeps the marker for the operator. The admin API gains
  `backup.stageRestore` and a `backup.restart` control.

- **GitHub Releases as a backup target.** Alongside S3-compatible storage, a
  backup can now sync to a (private) GitHub repo: each bundle becomes a Release
  (tag = bundle name) with the bundle's files attached as release assets. No new
  dependency — it uses Node's built-in `fetch`; the fine-grained token is stored
  encrypted and never appears in URLs, logs, or errors. Configure via
  `backup.github.repo` / `backup.github.token` (dashboard or the
  `LIBRARIAN_BACKUP_GITHUB_REPO` / `LIBRARIAN_BACKUP_GITHUB_TOKEN` env vars).
- **Dashboard-managed backup schedule + run health.** The backup cadence,
  target, retention count, and an optional failure-alert webhook now live in
  admin settings (no redeploy to change). Each scheduled or manual backup
  records a `backup_runs` row (status, target, bytes, error, timestamps); the
  server runs a backup once the configured interval has elapsed, recovers a run
  left in-flight by a crash, and POSTs a generic-JSON alert to the webhook on
  failure. The schedule ships disabled by default; the legacy
  `LIBRARIAN_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MS` still enables backups for headless installs.

### Changed

- **Backup bundles are now gzipped (`format_version` 2).** Each file in a
  backup bundle (`librarian.sqlite`, `events.jsonl`, `memories.md`) is stored
  gzipped as `<name>.gz`, cutting bundle size by roughly 70% (the SQLite copy is
  mostly empty pages). The manifest records both the stored (compressed) and the
  uncompressed sha256/bytes per file. `restore` is backward-compatible — existing
  `format_version` 1 (uncompressed) bundles still restore — and now bounds
  decompression to each file's declared uncompressed size, refusing a malformed
  or zip-bomb `.gz` before it can exhaust memory.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Classifier admin cockpit at `/classifier`.** Operators configure
  the classifier worker (remote LLM connection, prompt version, enable
  flag) from the dashboard the same way they configure the curator. The
  page shows a configuration summary with a "Config has changed since
  the worker started" drift banner; a form with the LLM-connection
  fields and a masked token input that preserves the stored value on
  empty submit; a restart button that calls the new
  `classifierConfig.restartWorker` mutation (coalesces concurrent
  callers via the single-flight mutex documented in the spec); and a
  self-test button that runs the classifier package's
  `runSelfTest(SELF_TEST_INPUT)` against a transient classifier
  instance, returning verdict + latency + fallback reason. Worker
  drift detection uses a sha256 of the encrypted token blob so token
  rotation flips the hash without ever touching plaintext.
- **`@librarian/core` shared `llm-connection` helper.** The
  per-LLM-connection block (provider/endpoint/model/timeoutMs +
  encrypted token) used by both the curator and the new classifier
  config is now a single tested module. Curator-config delegates to
  it; classifier-config layers an enable flag + prompt version on top.
  Public surface:
  `LlmConnection`, `LlmConnectionPatch`, `LlmConnectionPatchSchema`,
  `llmConnectionKeys`, `readLlmConnection`, `writeLlmConnection`,
  `resolveLlmToken`.
- **`@librarian/core/classifier-config`.** Settings-store-backed
  config for the classifier worker.
  `readClassifierConfig` / `writeClassifierConfig` /
  `resolveClassifierToken` / `classifierConfigHash` /
  `findLegacyClassifierEnvKeys` / `ClassifierConfigPatchSchema`. The
  hash includes a sha256 fingerprint of the encrypted token blob, so
  rotation triggers drift without exposing plaintext.
- **`@librarian/mcp-server` store-driven classifier boot + restart +
  self-test.** `bootClassifierWorker({ store, … })` reads the stored
  config; `restartClassifierWorker(input)` implements the nine-step
  shutdown procedure with a single-flight mutex
  (outcomes: `started | stopped | restarted | already_in_progress |
  failed`); `runClassifierSelfTest(input)` builds a transient
  classifier, runs the fixture, and returns the result.
- **`classifierConfig` tRPC router** mounted on `appRouter`:
  `config` / `setConfig` / `workerState` / `restartWorker` /
  `selfTest`. All admin-gated; token never on the wire.

### Removed

- **Embedded local classifier provider (`node-llama-cpp`).** The
  in-process GGUF provider shipped in v0.2.0 — the `node-llama-cpp`
  optional native dependency, the Node-Worker inference host, the
  curated model `CATALOG`, the HuggingFace download plumbing, and the
  `providerMode` config discriminator — is removed. The classifier is
  **remote-only**: point the LLM connection at any OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint, including a self-hosted **ollama / vllm / llama.cpp** server
  URL, for local inference. This drops a ~300MB native dependency that
  never installed in the read-only Docker image anyway. No migration
  needed — a stored `provider_mode = "local"` reads back as remote and
  reports "not operational" until an endpoint is configured; orphaned
  `classifier.local.*` settings are ignored. `ClassifierConfig` loses
  its `providerMode` and `local` fields (`isOperational === enabled &&
  isLlmComplete`), so the config hash changes once, showing a one-time
  drift banner cleared by a worker restart. `classifier-eval`'s
  `--provider` now accepts only `remote`.
- **`LIBRARIAN_CLASSIFIER_*` env vars retired** in favour of admin-
  settings persistence (see the cockpit above). Boot logs a one-line
  `classifier_env_retired` notice if any of the seven retired keys
  (`_ENABLED`, `_PROVIDER`, `_REMOTE_ENDPOINT`, `_REMOTE_TOKEN`,
  `_REMOTE_MODEL`, `_LOCAL_MODEL`, `_LOCAL_QUANT`) are still set, with
  a hint to migrate to the cockpit. A new CI guard
  (`scripts/check-classifier-env-retirement.mjs`, wired into the
  guards job) `git grep`s the repo for new references and fails the
  build on any occurrence outside the explicit allowlist (the
  retirement-related source / tests / docs + classifier-eval's
  separate CLI env contract + the `_LOCAL_E2E` integration-test
  flag).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- **v18 → v19 sessions-rethink migration crash on boot.** The PR 7
  drop-and-rebuild path tried to pre-drop the FTS5 shadow tables
  (`session_events_fts_data` etc.) before the parent virtual table,
  which SQLite refuses (`table … may not be dropped`). The first
  statement threw and `ensureSchema` aborted, leaving the server
  unable to start against any v18 database. Fix drops only the
  virtual table — SQLite cleans up its shadows atomically — wrapped
  in try/catch in case an exotic half-migrated DB has an orphan
  `session_events_fts` row in `sqlite_master` without shadows.
  Reported by the Hermes deploy at startup. Regression test pins the
  v18 → v19 path.

### Added

- **Responsive memories page + hamburger nav on small screens.** The
  memories page outer grid now stacks below `lg` (1024px) — the
  filter sidebar collapses above the list with a
  `<details>`-driven "Filters & recall" toggle, so a phone-sized
  viewport gets a usable list column instead of a 30px sliver. The
  site nav swaps `flex flex-wrap` for a hamburger pattern below `md`
  (768px) — inline SVG icon with `aria-expanded` / `aria-controls`,
  drawer below the bar when open, auto-closes on route change. The
  right-hand controls (version badge, theme toggle, sign-out) stay
  visible at every width.
- **Release runbook + per-repo release docs.** Canonical cross-family
  release procedure lives at
  [`docs/release-runbook.md`](docs/release-runbook.md); the per-repo
  steps and decision rules at [`docs/release.md`](docs/release.md).
  AGENTS.md thinned to point at both — the bump-size rule and
  per-procedure steps no longer duplicate inline. Sibling plugin repos
  pick up matching `docs/release.md` files that cross-link to the
  monorepo runbook.

### Removed

- **Session subsystem retired (sessions-rethink PR 7).** The thirteen
  session MCP tools (`start_session`, `get_session`, `list_sessions`,
  `list_session_events`, `search_sessions`, `record_session_event`,
  `checkpoint_session`, `pause_session`, `end_session`, `attach_session`,
  `continue_session`, `promote_session_fact`, plus the older retired
  `archive_session` / `restore_session` / `delete_session`) are gone.
  The CLI's `the-librarian sessions <verb>` family, the dashboard's
  `/sessions` and `/sessions/[id]` surfaces, the `lib-session-*` and
  `lib-toggle-private` slash commands, the `sessionsRouter` tRPC
  surface, the session formatters (`renderHandover*`), the
  `scripts/check-session-state-divergence.mjs` /
  `scripts/migrate-sessions-to-authoritative-sqlite.mjs` scripts, and
  the corresponding healthcheck probe are all retired. Plugin repos
  have already been trimmed in parallel PRs (claude-plugin #12,
  codex-plugin #6, opencode-plugin #6, hermes-plugin #21,
  pi-extension #10) — they now register only the conv-state injection
  hook and rely on the `/handoff`, `/takeover`, `/learn`,
  `/toggle-private` slash surface for cross-harness continuity.
  **Schema break:** projection bumps 18 → 19 and drops the
  `sessions`, `session_state_changes`, `session_events`, and
  `session_events_fts*` tables. Existing memory data is unaffected
  (events.jsonl is the source of truth); leftover
  `session_events.jsonl` / `sessions.legacy.jsonl` files are renamed
  to `.predeprecation.bak` on next open so operators can see they've
  been retired but no data is silently deleted. Older backup bundles
  carrying the old ledger files restore cleanly — the post-PR-7 store
  ignores them on open.

### Added

- **Dashboard version badge with "behind latest" indicator.** A small
  `v<version>` chip in the nav bar shows the running build's version
  (read from the root `package.json` at boot, surfaced via a new public
  `health.info` tRPC procedure). A coloured dot + native browser
  tooltip indicates whether the local build is up to date, behind the
  latest GitHub release, or in a "couldn't check" state (no releases
  yet, rate-limited, or the host is offline). Clicking the badge opens
  the matching release notes in a new tab. The GitHub lookup is cached
  for an hour, lifts to 5000 req/h when `LIBRARIAN_GITHUB_TOKEN` is
  set, and can be disabled entirely with
  `LIBRARIAN_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=true` for air-gapped instances.
  Downstream forks can point the check at a different repo via
  `LIBRARIAN_GITHUB_REPO=org/repo`.
- **Handoffs surface (sessions-rethink PR 1, additive).** Three new MCP
  tools — `store_handoff`, `list_handoffs`, `claim_handoff` — back a new
  `handoffs` SQLite table that records self-contained narrative handoffs
  for cross-harness pickup. The atomic `claim_handoff` wraps an UPDATE +
  SELECT in `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` so two concurrent claimants always pick a
  single winner (404 vs 409 distinguish unknown rows from already-claimed
  ones). Server-side domain isolation matches the memory tools.
  Companion surfaces: a `the-librarian handoffs <list|show|purge>` CLI
  family (purge is admin-only), a read-only dashboard at `/handoffs`
  with a list view + detail view (no claim button — that's an agent
  operation), and four new Claude Code slash commands
  (`/handoff`, `/takeover`, `/learn`, `/toggle-private`) shipping the
  agent-side contract from spec §6.5. Healthcheck allow-list updated.
  **The old session surface (13 MCP tools, `lib-session-*` commands) is
  untouched** — both surfaces live side-by-side until PR 7 removes the
  old one. Schema bumps 17 → 18; the new table is authoritative and
  preserved across future projection rebuilds.

### Changed

- **Memory curator decouples from sessions (sessions-rethink PR 0).** The
  curator is now memory-only. The session-evidence path
  (`gatherSessionEvidence`, `SessionEvidenceBundle`, `source_session_ids`,
  `input_session_ids`) is gone from `curator-evidence.ts`,
  `curator-worker.ts`, `curator-prompt.ts`, `curator-output.ts`,
  `curator-validate.ts`, `curator-apply.ts`, and the curation-store
  schemas. The session-derived `safe` discriminator (and the implicit
  "strong session-backed evidence" shortcut for `create`) is retired;
  exact-duplicate `safe` survives. Curation runs no longer hash session
  ids into their input fingerprint. **Schema break:** projection bumps
  16 → 17 and drops `memory_curation_runs.input_session_ids` and
  `memory_curation_operations.source_session_ids` via
  `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN`. Existing curation rows are preserved;
  the columns just disappear.
- **Curator cadence is disabled by default with an explicit operator
  opt-in (§12.4).** The legacy `curator.schedule.interval_days` /
  `curator.schedule.time` / `min_sessions_since_run` keys are retired
  and replaced by `curator.interval_minutes` (default 60, capped at one
  week). When `curator.enabled` is `false` (the default), the scheduler
  ticks but does nothing — no LLM calls, no runs created. When enabled,
  the scheduler runs every `curator.interval_minutes` from the slice's
  last completion; the previous self-gate on new-session counts is
  retired (sessions no longer drive the curator). Boot logs a one-line
  notice if legacy schedule keys are still in settings so operators
  know to migrate. Dashboard cockpit config form replaces the
  "every N days at HH:MM" inputs with a single "every N minutes" field.

### Added

- **`classifier-eval generate-fixture` CLI (Task 4.10).** Implements
  the spec §4.7 public-consensus fixture generation pipeline:
  generate ~1500 candidate memories via one strong LLM, run each
  through 3 frontier graders from different model families (Claude /
  GPT / Gemini) via the classifier's own v1 prompt, keep only
  unanimous candidates, trim to ~900 maintaining the 60/40 ratio,
  iterate if a bucket falls short. Configurable via a JSON file
  (`fixtures/graders.example.json` ships as a template) with tokens
  resolved from env-var references so the config is safe to commit.
  Hard `--max-calls` budget guard prevents runaway API spend; verbose
  per-iteration progress logging via `--verbose`; dry-run mode
  validates config + env without making any calls. The fixture
  itself is NOT generated in this PR — that's an operator one-shot
  with three API keys in hand (~$5 spend). 28 new unit tests cover
  consensus, ratio-preserving trim, generator prompt construction,
  CLI flag parsing, and an end-to-end pipeline test with in-memory
  fake clients. Documented in `packages/classifier-eval/README.md`.

### Removed

- **Legacy `category` / `visibility` / `scope` columns + dashboard
  dropdowns + `PROTECTED_CATEGORY_STRINGS` gate inside the store
  (Section 4d.3 final cleanup).** The schema bumps to v16 — the
  `memories` table loses three columns; the FTS table loses its
  `category` column. New writes don't carry those fields; legacy
  ledger events still parse (the projection ignores those fields on
  rebuild). Memory-side `visibility` is gone end to end; sessions
  still carry it for cross-agent handover.

  The curator's protected-routing rebased onto the
  classifier-decided `requires_approval` flag: the apply layer emits
  `options.requires_approval: true` for protected creates, the
  validate layer reads `requires_approval` on each evidence item
  (`category` is no longer carried on `MemoryEvidenceItem`).

  `createMemory` exposes an `options.requires_approval: boolean` (and
  `options.is_global`) channel for trusted internal callers (curator,
  dashboard, tests). Agent-supplied values via `input.requires_approval`
  are still ignored per spec §4.1/§4.4. The legacy
  `legacyProtected` short-circuit inside the store is retired.

  Dashboard UI: `NewMemoryForm`, `MemoryDetailPanel`, `MemoriesFilters`,
  `PromoteForm`, and the `(memories)/actions.ts` server actions all
  drop their category/visibility/scope inputs. The detail panel now
  surfaces `is_global` / `requires_approval` / `domain` pills built
  from the classifier verdict instead.

  Migration `scripts/migrate-add-domain-and-conv-state.mjs` is now a
  no-op on post-4d.3 schemas (legacy backfill target columns gone);
  it prints a clear message and exits cleanly.

- **Legacy `Category` / `Scope` enums + `deriveLegacyMemoryFlags` /
  `isProtectedCategory` (Section 4d.2 cleanup).** The classifier
  worker is now the source of truth for `is_global` and
  `requires_approval`; the legacy category-derived bridge is retired.
  `category` / `visibility` / `scope` remain as opaque free-text
  columns on the `memories` table for backward compatibility with
  pre-cutover ledger events; the projection no longer treats them as
  routing signals.

  Curator output schemas (`CuratorMemoryInputSchema`,
  `CuratorMemoryPatchSchema`) widen `category` / `scope` to
  `z.string()`. The `PROTECTED_CATEGORY_STRINGS` set survives as a
  legacy gate inside `createMemory` so identity / relationship
  strings still route to `requires_approval=true`+`status=proposed`
  until callers (curator apply, dashboard new-form) switch to
  emitting `requires_approval=true` directly.

  `startContext` is rewritten to bucket by `is_global=true` +
  agent-private rather than by category enum members.

  **No production behaviour change** beyond what Section 4d.1
  already shipped — the worker still decides the booleans on the
  write path; this PR retires the dead bridge code.

### Added

- **Classifier cutover (Section 4d.1 of the rollout-completion plan, halt-gated).**
  The classifier worker is now wired into `mcp-server`'s HTTP boot
  behind `LIBRARIAN_CLASSIFIER_ENABLED=true`. When the flag is set
  along with the provider-specific env (remote: endpoint + token +
  model; local: model id + optional quant), the worker starts at
  listen time and `remember` lands every new memory at conservative
  defaults (`is_global=false, requires_approval=true,
  status=proposed, classified=0`) — the worker then decides the
  two booleans asynchronously and emits `memory.classified`. When
  its verdict says `requires_approval=false`, the worker promotes
  the row from `proposed` to `active` so the recall filter sees it.
  When the env flag is unset (default), nothing changes — the legacy
  bridge in `normalizeMemoryInput` continues to derive the booleans
  from `category`, and the worker stays dormant.

  Projection rebuild now applies `memory.classified` events to the
  snapshot so a verdict survives a `pnpm rebuild` of the projection.
  Legacy-bridge writes carry `classified=1` on the snapshot (the
  worker has nothing to do); pendingClassification writes carry
  `classified=0`.

  New `scripts/migrate-enqueue-existing-memories.mjs` flips every
  existing row in `memories` to `classified=0, classification_attempts=0`
  so the worker drains the canonical instance's backfill queue
  post-cutover. Dry-run by default; `--apply` writes. Idempotent.

  **Halt gates on the canonical instance:** if the first 100
  classifications show `fallback_used: "max_retries"` rate > 20%
  (the spec §4.3 soft-alert threshold; dashboard banner surfaces
  it), HALT and investigate model configuration before continuing.
  The plan's §7.3 column drop + enum removal + dashboard-UI cleanup
  is deferred to 4d.2 (low-risk follow-up; runs after backfill is
  confirmed healthy).

- **Classifier evaluation surface (Section 4c of the rollout-completion plan).**
  New workspace package `@librarian/classifier-eval` ships the eval
  runner + a CLI bin (`classifier-eval run --provider remote --model
  <id> --sample 10 --category boundary`) and a soft-alert helper that
  computes the §4.3 max-retries rate over a window. The dashboard
  gains a `/classifier-eval` admin page that runs evals against a
  remote OpenAI-compatible endpoint (configured per-run via a form;
  persistent admin config arrives in 4d) and renders agreement
  metrics, per-category disagreement, latency distribution, and
  fallback counts. A banner appears at the top of the page when the
  recent classification window crosses the 20% max-retries threshold
  (spec §4.3). Each successful eval appends a
  `classifier.evaluation_completed` event (new `MemoryEventType`
  variant) so the timeline survives reloads. A 12-entry seed fixture
  at `packages/classifier-eval/fixtures/seed-v1.json` covers every
  verdict quadrant and includes boundary cases; the consensus-graded
  public fixture from spec §4.7 (~900 entries) lands in a follow-up.

  **No production behavior change.** Soft-alert returns zeros until
  Section 4d wires the worker into mcp-server startup so
  `memory.classified` events start flowing.

- **Classifier local provider (Section 4b of the rollout-completion plan).**
  `@librarian/classifier` now ships a `local` provider that runs GGUF
  models via [`node-llama-cpp`](https://github.com/withcatai/node-llama-cpp)
  on a Node worker thread, keeping the mcp-server's event loop
  responsive while inference blocks. `node-llama-cpp` is declared as an
  `optionalDependency` so installs without local mode complete cleanly
  on platforms where the native build fails. A six-model catalog (spec
  §4.3 — Qwen 3.5 0.8B / LFM 2.5 1.2B Instruct + Thinking / Qwen 3.5
  2B / Phi-4-mini / Gemma 4 E2B; LFM 2.5 1.2B Instruct is the default)
  is committed at `packages/classifier/src/catalog.ts`. A new
  `runSelfTest()` helper exercises the classifier against a known
  identity-shaped memory and surfaces the raw model output on parse
  failure — the dashboard's custom-model save path uses it to reject
  configs that can't produce parseable JSON. The provider router now
  requires `deps.inferenceFor` for `provider: "local"` and `deps.llm`
  for `provider: "remote"` — misconfiguration throws at construction
  rather than silently returning conservative defaults. The 4a-era
  `LIBRARIAN_CLASSIFIER_LOCAL_STUB` env-flag escape hatch is retired —
  the local provider is now the production wiring.

  **Still no behavior change in production.** The worker
  (`createClassifierWorker`) is not wired into mcp-server startup;
  that lands in Section 4d.

- **Classifier foundation (Section 4a of the rollout-completion plan).**
  New workspace package `@librarian/classifier` with a remote (OpenAI-
  compatible) provider, the v1 prompt template, and the parser that
  folds every model output failure to a conservative-defaults verdict
  with a `fallback_used` tag (`parse` / `timeout` / `provider_unavailable`).
  Two new `memories` columns — `classified` and
  `classification_attempts` — both `INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` (schema
  bump v14 → v15). A new `memory.classified` event variant on the
  ledger schema (spec §4.8). A new async worker scaffold at
  `packages/mcp-server/src/classifier-worker.ts` that drains the
  `classified = 0` queue, retries on parse / provider failures up to 3
  attempts, then gives up with conservative defaults + an event marked
  `fallback_used: "max_retries"`.

  **No behavior change.** The worker module exists but is NOT wired
  into mcp-server startup; no code path writes `classified = 0` yet,
  so the worker has nothing to do in production. New memories continue
  through the legacy `deriveLegacyMemoryFlags` path until Section 4d
  performs the cutover (with the migration backfill).

- **CLI `--conv-id` flag on `sessions start` (PR 5 of 8, T5.3 only).**
  Mirrors the new harness hook contract — when the operator pipes a
  series of CLI invocations together (e.g. `LIBRARIAN_CONV_ID=cli:work`
  in their shell), `sessions start` now inherits the domain from the
  matching `conversation_state` row. Single-domain installs continue
  to default to `general` through the §4.10 fast path. The Claude
  Code and Hermes plugin work (T5.1 + T5.2) lives in sibling repos
  and is out of scope for this PR.

- **Dashboard `/domains` page (PR 4 of 8, T4.1 only).** Owner-curated
  list of domains via a new admin tRPC router (`domains.list`,
  `domains.add`, `domains.remove`) on top of a `createDomainsStore`
  surface in `@librarian/core`. Removing a non-floor domain reassigns
  its memories to `general` rather than deleting them — agents can't
  lose content because the owner tidied up. The `general` floor cannot
  be removed (the §4.10 fast path depends on it). T4.2 (signal-rules),
  T4.3 (proposal modal), T4.4 (memory detail panel toggles), and T4.5
  (filter UI rewrite) deferred to follow-up sub-PRs per the plan's
  "split if any one task balloons" guidance.

- **Domain enforcement on memory + session writes (PR 3 of 8).** The
  `remember`, `recall`, `start_session`, and `continue_session` MCP
  tools now consume the conv-state registry from PR 2:
  - `remember` reads `conv_state.domain` for the supplied `conv_id` and
    server-sets the memory's `domain` accordingly. Calls without a
    matching conv_state row on a multi-domain install route to the
    proposal queue with `domain=NULL` and `requires_approval=true` per
    spec §4.14, so the dashboard owner picks the domain at approval
    time. The §4.10 single-domain fast path keeps zero-config installs
    zero-friction — when only `general` exists, the sole domain is
    auto-assigned without the proposal hop.
  - `recall` applies the §4.11 hard filter
    `(domain = current_domain OR is_global = 1) AND status = active`,
    drops the legacy `categories` and `include_private` inputs, and
    adds `tags` plus `include_other_domains`. Admin callers bypass the
    filter via the existing role flag.
  - `start_session` inherits its `domain` from the calling conv_state;
    `continue_session` seeds the resuming conv_state's domain from
    `session.domain` when a `conv_id` is supplied (skipping the
    signal-precedence chain on resume per §4.12).
  - `listMemories` (the dashboard read path) gains
    `domain` / `is_global` / `requires_approval` / `tags` filter axes
    alongside the existing surface.

- **Conversation-state registry and hook helpers (PR 2 of 8).**
  Per-conversation runtime state from spec §4.8 lands as a new SQLite-
  authoritative store on top of the `conversation_state` table from
  PR 1. The agent surface gains three MCP tools — `conv_state_get`,
  `conv_state_upsert`, `conv_state_clear` — that hook code in PR 5 will
  call every turn to defeat compaction-driven state loss. The pure
  helper `renderConvStateBlock(state)` returns the canonical
  `<conversation-state>` block from spec §4.9 byte-for-byte, so every
  harness integration reads one source of truth. No agent-visible
  behaviour change yet — PR 3 wires `remember` and `recall` to consume
  the registry.

- **Memory domain-isolation foundation (PR 1 of 8).** Additive schema for
  the new owner-controlled isolation model (`domain`, `is_global`,
  `requires_approval` columns on memories, `domain` on sessions, plus the
  four authoritative tables `conversation_state`, `domains`,
  `signal_rules`, `token_domain_bindings`). The two policy booleans are
  derived from the legacy `category` column as a temporary bridge until
  the write-path classifier ships in PR 6. The `general` domain is
  auto-seeded on first boot, and the `legacy-private` domain is
  synthesised on the fly by `scripts/migrate-add-domain-and-conv-state.mjs`
  for any historical `agent_private` memories. No behaviour change on
  reads or writes — existing tools see the new columns as defaulted
  metadata.

### Fixed

- **`rowToMemory` JSON-parse crash on corrupt `_json` columns.** A single
  corrupt `tags_json`, `applies_to_json`, `supersedes_json`,
  `conflicts_with_json`, or `curator_note` column in the SQLite `memories`
  table would crash every query that reads memory rows (`listMemories`,
  `listAll`, `getMemory`) with an uncaught `SyntaxError`, manifesting as a
  500 / JSON-RPC -32603 on the dashboard and MCP calls. The read path now
  wraps each `JSON.parse` in defensive helpers that log the corruption to
  stderr and fall back to safe defaults (`[]` or `null`) — one bad row no
  longer blocks the user's turn (fail-soft principle).

### Added

- `AGENTS.md` with the family-wide house rules (privacy, fail-soft,
  cross-repo contracts, etc.) and the main-repo build / test / gotcha
  notes. Sibling AGENTS.md files in the four standalone plugin repos
  share the same baseline so an agent dropped into any repo of the
  family behaves consistently.

### Changed

- **README front-loaded with the harness integrations section.** Moved
  the section to sit immediately before `## Features` so the install
  commands are the first concrete thing readers see (was previously
  buried below CLI / Curator). Each of the five harnesses gets a
  brand-coloured shields.io badge (Claude Code terracotta with the
  Anthropic mark, Codex purple with the OpenAI mark, Hermes gold with
  the dark LobeHub Hermes icon embedded via base64, OpenCode npm
  orange with the npm mark, Pi blue) plus a collapsible `<details>`
  block with the exact install one-liner — no need to navigate to the
  plugin repo for a basic install. The "Harness integrations" bullet
  in the Features list dropped (now redundant with the section right
  above).

### Removed

- `integrations/codex/` and `integrations/pi/` — both harnesses now
  ship as standalone, installable plugins
  ([`the-librarian-codex-plugin`](https://github.com/JimJafar/the-librarian-codex-plugin),
  [`the-librarian-pi-extension`](https://github.com/JimJafar/the-librarian-pi-extension)),
  so the in-tree copyable packages were retired to keep one source of
  truth per harness.
- `@librarian/lifecycle`'s Codex adapter (`src/harness/codex.ts`,
  `src/bin/codex-hook.ts`, the `librarian-codex-hook` bin entry, and
  the `harness-codex.test.ts` suite) — orphaned by the
  `integrations/codex/` removal. The standalone Codex plugin bundles
  its own hook from the Claude plugin's pattern and doesn't depend on
  this package.
- `integrations/opencode/` — opencode has graduated to a standalone
  plugin too ([`the-librarian-opencode-plugin`](https://github.com/JimJafar/the-librarian-opencode-plugin)).
  All five harnesses now ship as standalone repos; no in-tree harness
  packages remain.
- The `integration-wrappers` CI matrix job in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (was opencode-only after the codex+pi
  graduation; now empty → deleted entirely).
- **`integrations/` directory deleted entirely.** With opencode shipping
  as a standalone plugin, every in-tree harness package has graduated;
  the `@librarian/lifecycle` workspace package was orphaned (zero
  consumers outside its own package.json) and removed alongside the
  per-harness packages. The privacy detector source that lived in
  `integrations/shared/librarian-lifecycle/src/privacy.ts` was already
  byte-identically ported into all four plugin repos; the opencode
  plugin's `src/privacy-detector.ts` becomes the de facto canonical TS
  going forward (the four ports are now peers — coordinate any change
  across all four).
- `integrations/shared/*` entry removed from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- `test/integrations.test.ts` renamed to `test/repo-structure.test.ts`
  with reduced scope: dropped the integrations/README.md link check;
  retained the `.claude/commands` per-verb check; added a regression
  test asserting `integrations/` doesn't exist.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-26

Public baseline. The Librarian is a portable memory + session layer for AI
agents: one disciplined funnel for recalling, proposing, saving, updating,
and reviewing durable context, plus a neutral cross-harness
session-continuity layer so work started in one harness (Claude Code,
Codex, Hermes, OpenCode, Pi) can be handed off and resumed cleanly in
another.

### Shipped in this baseline

- **Durable memory** — `recall` / `remember` / `verify` over a three-state
  (`active` / `proposed` / `archived`) model, with categories, `common` vs
  `agent_private` scoping, and a proposal flow for protected categories
  (`identity`, `relationship`).
- **Cross-harness sessions** — `start` / `checkpoint` / `pause` / `end` /
  `continue` over a three-state (`active` / `paused` / `ended`) model, with
  a handover package any harness can resume. Session history is evidence;
  durable facts are promoted explicitly.
- **MCP server** — HTTP transport, bearer-token auth, the full tool surface
  including the admin-only verbs surfaced when authenticated with an admin
  token.
- **Memory curator** — an optional scheduled LLM pass that grooms memory
  (dedupe, archive stale, refine), configured and observed from the
  dashboard.
- **Dashboard** — a Next.js admin cockpit (Memories, Sessions, Recall,
  Proposals, Archive, Logs, Analytics, and the Curator cockpit) with a
  persistent nav and ⌘K command palette.
- **Storage** — event-sourced and dependency-light: append-only JSONL
  ledgers + a generated SQLite/FTS5 index on `node:sqlite`. No external
  database required.
- **Harness integrations** — two standalone, installable plugins (Claude
  Code, Hermes) plus copyable setup packages under `integrations/` for the
  rest. See [Harness integrations](./README.md#harness-integrations).
