// The Librarian's 7 agent verbs, registered natively in the extension.
//
// Pi's CORE has no MCP support (the `mcp.json` / mcpServers feature lives in
// third-party adapter extensions, not the runtime). So rather than ask every
// user to install an MCP adapter and hand-place a config file, the extension
// exposes the Librarian's tools to the model itself via `pi.registerTool`,
// proxying each call as a `tools/call` over HTTP. One `pi install`, zero config.
//
// Tool descriptions are the teaching surface (rethink spec §5.1): each one is
// copied VERBATIM from `@librarian/mcp-server/src/mcp/tools/<verb>.ts` so Pi
// users see exactly what every other harness sees. Schemas mirror the server's
// `inputSchema`s minus `agent_id` (the server resolves the caller from the
// bearer token) and the retired `conv_id`. Server fields typed
// `["string","null"]` are exposed here as optional strings — omission and null
// are equivalent for those filters, and a plain `string` type survives every
// provider's schema translation (Google's rejects type arrays). The
// schema-parity drift guard in `tests/schema-parity.test.ts` pins all of this
// against the server package mechanically.
//
// Fail-soft (AGENTS.md §2): a proxy NEVER throws into the harness. A network /
// server failure comes back as a short error string the model can read and
// route around — the user's turn is never broken by a Librarian outage.
