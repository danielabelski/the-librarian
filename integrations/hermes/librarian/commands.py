"""Hermes in-session slash commands for The Librarian — optional sugar.

The primer (served via ``system_prompt_block``) is the canonical definition of
these protocols (rethink D9); the commands below are thin prompt templates over
the same 7-verb MCP surface, registered only where Hermes makes that cheap.
``docs/slash-commands.md`` in the monorepo is the wording reference.

Hermes slash commands are registered programmatically via
``ctx.register_command(name, handler, description, args_hint)``. Each handler
has the signature ``fn(raw_args: str) -> str | None``. They are only wired when
the plugin is loaded as a *general* plugin (``hermes plugins enable librarian``);
activating the memory provider alone does not register them — and nothing is
lost if they never register, because the primer teaches the same protocols.

A Hermes ``fn(raw_args)`` handler is non-interactive, so each command surfaces
the prompt that drives the LLM rather than running the multi-step flow itself.
The LLM, having read the primer, then performs the actual MCP calls.
