# Harness automatic-capture capability matrix

Automatic capture (spec `2026-06-16-harness-auto-capture`, ADR 0009) feeds a
**uniform server contract** — the `POST /transcript` delta endpoint — through a
thin **per-harness acquisition adapter**. The server pipeline (buffer →
settle-sweep → extractor → curator) is built once and shared; only the small
adapter that *acquires* a per-turn delta differs per harness. This page is the
honest, seeded status of each harness (spec SC14), grounded in the §11.2
capability audit of the capture brainstorm and the §6 live test, and
**re-grounded in Phase 2A** against [mem0's shipping plugin](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0)
— which proves Codex (same hook events as Claude) and OpenCode (`chat.message`),
correcting the earlier "Codex blocked / OpenCode idle-bracketing" framing.

The three columns that decide whether a harness can capture at all:

- **Capture mechanism** — how the adapter gets a per-turn delta.
- **conv_id stability** — capture keys all per-conversation state by a stable
  conversation id (never `$USER` or `cwd`, spec §4.11). A harness without a
  stable id can't attribute deltas safely and is blocked.
- **Status** — whether Phase 1 ships it, and what gates the rest.

| Harness | Capture mechanism | conv_id stability | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | `UserPromptSubmit` hook (primary) → tail the top-level `transcript_path` JSONL from a **byte-offset cursor** (subagents skipped; private turns skipped); `Stop` / `SessionEnd` kept as supplementary | **stable** — `session_id`; concurrent sessions write distinct `<session_id>.jsonl` files (§6) | **Authoritative (shipped)**. Driven by **`UserPromptSubmit`** because Claude bug [#29767](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/29767) means plugin-scoped `Stop` hooks register but never fire; `Stop` / `SessionEnd` stay wired so capture **auto-recovers** when the bug is fixed. Shipped in `integrations/claude/hooks/hooks.json`. |
| **Claude Cowork** (desktop) | **None new** — Cowork shares Claude Code's plugin host, so the same `integrations/claude/` hooks (`on-stop.mjs`) are the acquisition surface | inherits Claude's `session_id` (**assumed**, unverified on the desktop host) | **Blocked on verification (Phase 2A).** No new adapter — the same Claude plugin *is* the surface. Needs the Claude **desktop app** to confirm its plugin host fires the per-turn `UserPromptSubmit` / `Stop` / `SessionEnd` hooks with a usable `transcript_path` + session id (and whether #29767 manifests there too). GUI install (Customize → Browse plugins) is documented in the Claude README; capture is fail-soft if the desktop host diverges. |
| **Codex** | `UserPromptSubmit` hook (primary) → reuse the Claude adapter (`on-stop.mjs` + `lib/*`) on the per-turn delta; `Stop` / `SessionEnd` supplementary. Installed by **merging into `~/.codex/hooks.json`** (owner-marker idempotent; requires `codex_hooks = true` in `config.toml`) | **assumed stable** — `session_id` → transcript-filename basename → clean no-op; **never `cwd` / `$USER`** | **Ported (Phase 2A), e2e UNVERIFIED.** Built optimistically from mem0's shipping Codex hooks (`install_codex_hooks.py`, `codex-hooks.json`), which use the **same hook events as Claude**. The earlier "blocked: no stable id" status is resolved **iff** the live Codex payload carries `transcript_path` + a `session_id` — **not yet confirmed** (no `codex` CLI to spike). `deriveConvId` degrades gracefully and the parser is fail-soft, so a wrong payload shape no-ops rather than mis-attributing. |
| **OpenCode** | `chat.message` plugin hook (TS, `@opencode-ai/plugin`) → build the per-turn delta from the full ordered message list (`session.messages`, both roles); fires on the user message, so the assistant reply lands one turn behind (the §8.2 tolerance) | **stable** — `sessionID` (confirmed in the v1.16.2 API) | **Ported (Phase 2A), e2e pending.** Real TS plugin modeled on mem0's `opencode-mem0.ts`, but keyed by `sessionID` (not mem0's `$USER` — the collision bug we avoid). Unit + live-local-server contract verified; live OpenCode e2e pending (no `opencode` CLI). Corrects the earlier `session.idle`-bracketing guess. |
| **Pi** | `turn_end` / `agent_end` event → completed `AgentMessage` **in-payload** (O(1), no cursor) | **stable** — `getSessionId()` | **Feasible (in-payload)** — proven floor. Adapter is **Phase 2B** (spike-gated, SP-Pi). |
| **Hermes** | `sync_turn(user, assistant)` → both halves handed in as args **in-payload** (O(1)) | **stable** — `session_id` | **Feasible (in-payload)** — the cleanest surface. Adapter is **Phase 2B** (spike-gated, SP-Hermes). |

## Why Claude is first

Claude Code is the harness the owner uses daily, so Phase 1 builds and dogfoods
it. The §6 live test confirmed the data layer directly: the transcript is clean
append-only JSONL (so a byte-offset cursor is valid), each entry carries a stable
`sessionId`, concurrent sessions write distinct files, subagent work is isolated
in separate `subagents/*.jsonl`, and `cwd` can change *within* a session — which
is exactly why the buffer is keyed by `conv_id`, not `cwd`.

Capture is **driven by `UserPromptSubmit`**, not `Stop`. Claude bug
[#29767](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/29767) is that
plugin-scoped `Stop` hooks register but never fire (a `SessionStart` from the same
plugin *does* fire), so a `Stop`-only adapter would silently never run.
`UserPromptSubmit` fires reliably and carries the same `session_id` +
`transcript_path`, so the adapter reads the same per-turn delta — one turn behind
(it fires just before the assistant reply), which spec §8.2 already tolerates. The
`Stop` / `SessionEnd` entries stay wired as supplementary so capture
**auto-recovers** the moment the bug is fixed; the cursor's advance-on-ack makes
multiple firing events idempotent.

## Behavior shared by every adapter

These are contract-level, not per-harness:

- **Default-on**, gated two ways (see the [slash-command / private-mode
  contract](./slash-commands.md#automatic-capture-default-on-with-two-gates)):
  the per-machine **`LIBRARIAN_AUTO_SAVE=false`** kill-switch and per-turn
  **private-mode skip** (`[librarian:private=on]`).
- **Server-authoritative intake gate.** Even with the client shipping, the
  server buffers only when its curator intake gate (`curator.intake.enabled`) is
  on; if off it refuses and buffers nothing (no raw text at rest for a dead
  pipeline). The Claude **SessionStart banner** surfaces both gate states.
- **Fail-soft.** A capture/guard/extraction error never blocks the user's turn,
  never leaks a stack trace into the model's context, and errs toward *not*
  capturing on any uncertainty.

See the [Phase-1 spec](./specs/2026-06-16-harness-auto-capture.md) for the full
success criteria and the [Claude integration README](../integrations/claude/README.md)
for the shipped hooks.
