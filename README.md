> **[Project site →](https://codeministry.net/the-librarian/)** — what The Librarian is, how it works, and why you'd want it.

**The Librarian is a living, markdown-native knowledge graph for AI agents — with
a resident curator that tends it.** It is a markdown+git vault of three note
types — **memories**, **handoffs**, and **references** — linked into a graph by
`[[wikilinks]]`; a resident "librarian" curates the collection as it grows,
filing each new memory where it belongs, linking it to its neighbours, and
organising the whole for *retrieval*, not just storage. It's all plain files you
can read, edit, and reorganise yourself (in the dashboard or in Obsidian); git
gives it history; nothing is locked in a database.

Practically, that makes it a portable **memory + handoff layer for AI agents**:
served to any harness over MCP as **7 verbs**, taught to agents by one ≤2KB
**primer**, with an explicit **cross-harness handoff surface** so work started
in one harness (Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, OpenCode, Pi) can be packaged into a
single document and picked up cleanly in another.

It runs as a small self-hosted server, reachable locally or over the network.

## Self-host in one command

The `librarian` CLI's `server` command group stands up the server for you — it
builds and runs the all-in-one container, surfaces the master key once, and hands
you the MCP URL + agent token to paste into clients. Run it with `npx` — no
install needed:

```sh
npx @the-librarian/cli server up
```

(Or `npm i -g @the-librarian/cli` once and call `librarian server up` directly,
if you'll run it often.)

`server up`/`update`/`down`/`status`/`logs`, Linux boot persistence
(`enable-boot`), and host-side admin (`server admin backup|restore|auth|rebuild`)
are all covered in the
[one-command self-host guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md#one-command-self-host-librarian-server).

> **Use native Docker, not the snap.** `librarian server` is unsupported on
> snap-packaged Docker (common on Ubuntu / LXC) — its confinement breaks the build
> and hides container health. Install Docker CE. See
> [Docker engine: use native Docker, not snap](./DEPLOYMENT.md#docker-engine-use-native-docker-not-snap).

## Install on any harness

Once your server is running, the `librarian` CLI wires The Librarian into your
harnesses and keeps them up to date — the package-manager-style tool you keep.
It covers all five harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Hermes, Pi), drives
each one's native install path, and wires automatic capture where supported. Any
harness already has Node, so one command does it:

```sh
npx @the-librarian/cli install      # wire your harnesses; prompts for the MCP URL + token
npx @the-librarian/cli update       # later: bring every installed integration up to date
```

(Or install it globally once — `npm i -g @the-librarian/cli` — then run
`librarian install` / `librarian update` whenever you add or refresh a harness.)

See [`packages/installer-cli`](./packages/installer-cli/README.md) for the
full command reference and what it writes to your environment.

## Harness integrations

`librarian install` above wires all five for you; this section is the manual
reference for each. Run the server, then add one config block per harness. Claude
Code, Codex, and OpenCode need **no plugin code at all** — the MCP config (plus,
for OpenCode, one `instructions` line pointing at the server's `GET /primer.md`)
is a full integration. Hermes and Pi get thin in-tree adapters. Each harness's
exact config and install steps live in its README:

| Harness | Integration | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | [`integrations/claude`](./integrations/claude) | MCP config; optional plugin adds 4 slash commands |
| Codex | [`integrations/codex`](./integrations/codex) | MCP config block in `~/.codex/config.toml` — no code |
| OpenCode | [`integrations/opencode`](./integrations/opencode) | MCP config + one remote-URL `instructions` line — no code |
| Hermes | [`integrations/hermes`](./integrations/hermes) | Python MemoryProvider (stdlib-only) proxying the 7 verbs |
| Pi | [`integrations/pi`](./integrations/pi) | Pi extension: primer hook + 7 native tool proxies |

All five teach the model the same protocols: the primer rides each harness's
thinnest native channel (MCP `instructions` where honored, a one-hook adapter
where not), and the 7 tools carry protocol-bearing descriptions that render in
every harness.

## Features

- **Durable memory** — `recall` / `remember` / `flag_memory` over one shared,
  curated corpus with project-key scoping and a three-state
  (`active` / `proposed` / `archived`) model.
- **Cross-harness handoffs** — `store_handoff` packages the work in a
  five-section document; `claim_handoff` claims it atomically in another
  agent / harness.
- **References** — long-form background material (specs, papers, manuals)
  uploaded by the admin, chunk-indexed with persistently cached embeddings so a
  500KB document is searchable end-to-end via `search_references` — deliberately
  *not* auto-recalled.
- **Memory curator** — one curator, one prompt core, one apply rule: routine
  operations (`create`/`update`/`merge`) auto-apply above a single confidence
  threshold; destructive ones (`archive`/`split`) always become human-reviewed
  proposals.
- **Dashboard as the complete admin surface** — memory browser, proposal +
  flag queues, curator config/chat/run history, **vault explorer/editor**
  (Obsidian-lite: tree, rendered markdown, wikilinks, backlinks, validated
  editing), and **history/diff/rollback** backed by the server-owned git repo —
  operators never need git or Obsidian.

Markdown-native and dependency-light: memories are plain `[[wikilinked]]` notes
in a git-backed vault, recall runs over a disposable in-memory index (keyword +
vector + backlinks, RRF-fused) rebuilt from the vault — no external database to
run.

## Quick start

### Docker (recommended for a VPS)

```sh
cp .env.example .env   # optional — auth/secret vars auto-generate
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

A fresh install needs **zero** auth/secret env vars — `LIBRARIAN_SECRET_KEY`
auto-generates on first boot (watch the log for the one-time value). Set
`LIBRARIAN_AGENT_TOKEN` so remote agents can authenticate `/mcp`, then enable
owner login from the dashboard. Details in [Configuration](#configuration) and
[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

Then connect a harness: pick yours under [`integrations/`](./integrations) and
add the config block from its README.

### Local dev (two services)

Requirements: **Node 22.5+** and **pnpm 9.15.x** via Corepack:

```sh
corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@9.15.0 --activate
pnpm install
pnpm run seed                               # seed sample memories
pnpm run serve                              # mcp-server at http://127.0.0.1:3838
pnpm --filter @librarian/dashboard dev      # dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

```sh
pnpm run healthcheck                              # local end-to-end smoke
pnpm run healthcheck -- --remote http://host:3838 # probe a deployed instance
```

## Configuration

Auth and secrets are managed from the dashboard at **`/settings/auth`** (password
and/or GitHub/Google), enforced without a redeploy. Agent tokens are
dashboard-managed too — the **agent token is the network auth boundary**; there is
no admin token (the admin tRPC API is served only on a trusted internal listener,
never the published port — ADR 0008). A fresh install needs **zero** auth/secret
env vars; `LIBRARIAN_SECRET_KEY` is CLI-minted by `server up` into a `0600` deploy
env-file (off the data volume), or auto-generates on first boot in the
compose/no-env path.

For the host/port, data dir, the auth model, the master-key externalization
ladder, and the legacy env-configured auth path, see
[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

## MCP tools — the 7-verb agent surface

Agents talk to the Librarian over `/mcp` with a bearer token. The surface is
exactly seven tools — contract-tested, with zero internal tools:

### Memory

- `recall` — hybrid search over memories (`active` only by default; pass
  `include_ids: true` for `[mem_…]`-prefixed lines so callers can flag).
- `remember` — fire-and-forget: each submission lands in the curator's intake
  inbox; the curator dedupes, merges, and files it asynchronously.
- `flag_memory` — flag a memory as wrong / misleading / outdated with a
  free-text reason; routes it to review (and soft-demotes it in recall) rather
  than archiving unilaterally.

Memories are `active`, `proposed`, or `archived`. Admin/curatorial ops
(archive, approve, update, list proposals) are **not** agent MCP tools — they
live on the dashboard tRPC surface (ADR 0006).

### Handoffs

- `store_handoff` — store a handoff document (five required headings: *Start &
  intent*, *Journey*, *Current state*, *What's left*, *Open questions*).
- `list_handoffs` — list handoffs in the current project / cwd.
- `claim_handoff` — atomically claim a handoff by id. Claiming is one-shot —
  once claimed, the handoff is closed to other callers.

### References

- `search_references` — search the long-form reference corpus. A separate verb
  by design: references are background material, never auto-recalled.

## Teaching the agent — the primer

The teaching surface is the **primer** — one ≤2KB operator-editable document at
`vault/primer.md`, served at connect time as the MCP `initialize`
`instructions` field and at the unauthenticated `GET /primer.md` endpoint —
plus each tool's own protocol-bearing description. The primer carries the
recall/remember loop, the handoff/takeover and learn protocols, private mode,
and the fail-soft rule ("never block the user's work if the server is
unreachable"). Edit it from the dashboard's Vault page; the server enforces the
2KB cap on save. See
[`docs/adr/0007-the-rethink.md`](./docs/adr/0007-the-rethink.md) for the design.

### Slash commands (optional sugar)

`/handoff`, `/takeover`, `/learn`, and the local-only `/toggle-private` are
thin prompt templates over the primer protocols — nothing is lost on a harness
that only has the MCP config; saying "hand this off" or "go private" in plain
language works identically. The contract is in
[`docs/slash-commands.md`](./docs/slash-commands.md).

**Private mode** (`/toggle-private`, or just "go private") is an
in-conversation marker, not server state: while on, the agent makes no writes
(`remember`, `store_handoff`, `flag_memory`); `recall` / `search_references`
stay available, and those read queries do reach the server's logs.

## Dashboard

The Next.js admin cockpit (port `3000`) surfaces **Memories**, **Handoffs**,
**Analytics**, **Proposals**, **Flagged**, **Archive**, the **Curator** cockpit,
the **Vault** explorer, **Backups**, **Tokens**, and **Settings** — reachable
from a persistent top nav and a ⌘K command palette (`?` shows shortcuts). Owner
login is configured from **Settings → Auth**. The dashboard reaches the admin
tRPC API over a trusted internal listener with **no bearer** (ADR 0008) — the
published agent port serves no admin surface, so there is no admin credential to
reach the browser.

The **Vault** page is the Obsidian-lite admin surface: a tree over the whole
vault (memories, handoffs, references, `.curator/` addendums, `primer.md`),
rendered markdown with clickable wikilinks and a backlinks pane, and raw
editing with frontmatter validation on save — every save lands as a git commit
through the store layer. Per-file **history** shows the commit list and diffs
with "Restore this version" (a new revert commit — history is never
rewritten); the **Activity** feed shows every vault commit with curator
provenance and offers a guarded whole-vault restore (confirmation → curator
pause → pre-restore tag → revert commit).

## CLI

The `the-librarian` binary runs `rebuild`, `seed`, `backup` (push the vault to
the configured GitHub remote), `export`, `auth`, `handoffs`, and
`migrate-data-dir` (upgrade a pre-1.0 data dir: renames legacy bookkeeping,
strips retired frontmatter fields and settings keys, and *reports* — never
deletes — legacy artifacts):

```sh
the-librarian handoffs list --project the-librarian
the-librarian handoffs show hof_…
the-librarian handoffs purge hof_… --admin

the-librarian auth status                              # configured methods (no secrets)
the-librarian auth reset-password                      # set a new owner password
the-librarian auth disable                             # break-glass: turn enforcement off
```

Every handoff verb supports `--json`, `--agent <id>`, `--admin`, and the
project / cwd / harness scope flags.

## Memory curator

One curator engine with one versioned prompt core does two jobs, configured
and observed from the dashboard **Curator** cockpit (`/curator`) with parallel
**Intake** and **Grooming** sections (shared LLM provider management above
both):

- **Intake** consolidates each new submission as it lands in the inbox —
  gather evidence around it, then create / update / merge against the existing
  corpus.
- **Grooming** tends the existing corpus slice by slice (dedupe, archive
  stale, refine). Grooming is **triggered, not scheduled**: it runs from the
  dashboard's *Run now* and automatically after an intake sweep pushes enough
  new material past `curator.grooming.trigger_threshold` (rate-limited by
  `curator.grooming.debounce_minutes`).

**One apply rule** (ADR 0007): `create` / `update` / `merge` operations
auto-apply when the curator's confidence clears the single
`curator.apply.confidence_threshold` knob (default **0.8**); `archive` and
`split` — the only operations that destroy or restructure information —
**always** become proposals for human review, as does any operation touching a
`requires_approval` memory. Each job is enabled independently from the
dashboard (`curator.intake.enabled` / `curator.grooming.enabled`). The
curator's LLM API token is one of the server's own third-party credentials that
`LIBRARIAN_SECRET_KEY` encrypts in `settings.json` — the master key protects those
creds, not the vault (your memories stay plaintext markdown by design; ADR 0008).

### Tuning the curator — the self-improving loop

The curator improves through use. An admin teaches each job by editing its
**prompt addendum**, watches the results on real memories, and either keeps the
change or reverts it. Everything below is **admin-only** — there is no
agent-facing surface, and `recall` / navigate are untouched.

**Per-job addendum files (git-versioned).** Each job's prompt addendum is a
committed vault file — `<vault>/.curator/intake-addendum.md` and
`grooming-addendum.md` — appended to that job's prompt as **advisory**
guidance. Because it lives in git you get diff, revert, and backup for free.

**Edits apply immediately; git is the rollback.** Editing an addendum (from
the dashboard editor or the chat) commits the file and the job's next run
reads the new text — there is no evaluation gate. If an edit turns out badly,
restore the prior version from the file's history in the Vault page (a new,
revertable commit).

**Curator chat.** A dashboard chat — a **"discuss this memory"** entry on each
memory row plus a **general** entry — grounds the conversation in the memory and
its decision history. It can **propose** a fix-now mutation (merge / split /
update / **unmerge**) or an addendum edit, and the admin **confirms** each with an
explicit button: the curator proposes, it never executes against the live store
on its own (human-in-the-loop). A co-authored addendum over **2 KB** triggers a
soft **condense** turn (rewrite tighter, preserving load-bearing rules) rather
than failing; the file write hard-rejects anything over 2 KB as a backstop.

**How it's kept safe — the admin judges real results.** The addendum is
**advisory only**: the curator's hard, safety, and structural rules stay
**code-re-checked regardless of what the addendum says**, so an addendum can
shape judgement but never override an invariant. The guards are deliberately
simple and human-centred:

1. **Code re-check** of the hard/safety/structural rules on every operation,
   independent of the addendum.
2. The **2 KB cap** (soft condense + hard write backstop) keeps an addendum from
   growing into an unbounded second prompt.
3. **Git-versioned addendums** — every edit is a commit; a bad edit is one
   restore away, and the proposals it produced are reviewable in the queue.

You read the actual proposals the change produced and decide; the loop is tuned
by a human judging real results, not by a metric.
