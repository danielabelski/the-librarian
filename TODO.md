# The Librarian — Outstanding work

Snapshot taken 2026-05-18 after shipping Phases 1–6 of `specs/session-layer-and-harness-packages.md` (commits `0d7a329..42935b7`, all on `main`). Items reflect what was open at that point; check the active session's `next_steps` for fresher movement before relying on this list.

## Open from the active session

Active session at time of writing: `ses_e4e7fc21-0096-42b4-b091-5701c84539e5` ("Verifying /lib-session-* native commands").

1. **Exercise the remaining `/lib-session-*` verbs end-to-end** (resume, checkpoint, pause, archive, restore, delete, search) to confirm Claude Code dispatches each natively. Start was verified. Status was verified.
2. **Run `npm run healthcheck` against the deployed canonical instance.** It passes locally — needs a run against the production Librarian to validate the actual deployment.
3. **Click through the Sessions dashboard tab in a real browser.** Server-side wiring is covered by HTTP + curl smoke; visual layout and button handlers have never been exercised interactively.
4. **Configure `LIBRARIAN_AGENT_TOKENS` on the canonical server** so Claude Code session calls attribute to a real `agent_id`. Today they record as `unknown-agent` because no per-agent token is mapped for the Claude Code client.
5. **Decide whether to promote any of yesterday's decisions into durable memory.** My read so far is that none meet the bar (the substantive work is in git, the operational facts are observable from the dashboard), but worth a deliberate pass.

## Cross-harness follow-ups

6. **Hermes per-verb commands.** Pending Jim's answer on whether Hermes supports per-command registration with autocomplete. If it does, port the per-verb pattern; if not, stay with single-command-plus-parse and update the package docs accordingly.
7. **Codex slash surface (shelved).** Codex CLI has no user-invokable slash command primitive. Future call: ship a single `lib-session` skill that primes the agent on the verb surface, build a `UserPromptSubmit` hook that intercepts `/lib-session-*` and shells out, or wait for Codex to add native commands.
8. **Pi runtime (shelved).** Spec defers Pi's runtime as an open question. Revisit once Pi's interface is defined.

## Open repo issue

9. **`issues/001-dashboard-rest-no-auth.md` — REST endpoints lack authentication.** Discovered 2026-05-12 by Joseph. The `/api/*` routes on the dashboard have no auth gate while `/mcp` requires a Bearer token. The Phase 4.1 work I shipped (`/api/sessions/*`) extends this surface without fixing the underlying auth gap. Worth prioritising — this is the only outstanding item that's a real security risk rather than polish.

## Documentation cleanup

10. **Residual `/lib:session` references.** A few places still use the old `/lib:session <verb>` form where they should now use the per-verb name (`/lib-session-<verb>`). Confirmed offenders (run `rg "/lib:session"` to refresh):
    - `integrations/claude-code/CLAUDE.md` line 45 (`/lib:session resume <id>` → `/lib-session-resume <id>`) and line 57 (`/lib:session end`'s candidates → `/lib-session-end`'s candidate memories).
    - `integrations/claude-code/slash-commands.md` line 38 ("Hermes and OpenCode register a single `/lib:session` command…") — OpenCode is now per-verb too; that line needs to drop OpenCode and reference the canonical doc instead.
    - References that mention `/lib:session <verb>` as the **abstract cross-harness contract surface** are correct (e.g. `docs/slash-commands.md`, the "canonical contract" lines in each commands `.md`) and should stay.

## Spec open questions (deferred)

11. **`harness_private` visibility.** Add later if sandbox/test traffic patterns demand it.
12. **Physical purge of soft-deleted sessions.** Retention policy + admin UI.
13. **`session.split` / `session.merged` event types.** Revisit once usage patterns emerge.

## Harness integration ideas

14. **Auto-manage Librarian sessions via Claude Code lifecycle hooks.** Investigate whether Claude Code's hook surface can drive the Librarian lifecycle without the user typing `/lib-session-*` verbs manually. Sketch:
    - **`SessionEnd` → auto-pause** the attached Librarian session, but only when the user had resumed/attached one in this conversation. The `/lib-session-resume` skill already keeps the resumed `session_id` in conversational state — the hook would read that to decide whether to fire.
    - **`PostCompact` → auto-checkpoint** with the rolling summary so the compacted-away context lands in the ledger before it's gone. Likely the highest-value hook of the three since compaction is exactly where session evidence is most at risk.
    - **`TaskCompleted` (or equivalent) → auto-checkpoint** at a finer grain. Lower priority — risk of noisy ledger if every micro-task fires a checkpoint; might gate on "task touched ≥ N files" or similar.
    - Open questions: how to thread the resumed `session_id` into the hook process (env var? side-channel file?); whether to suppress hook-driven calls when an agent-side checkpoint just ran; whether other harnesses (Hermes, OpenCode) have analogous lifecycle events worth wiring the same way.

## Architecture — revisit later

15. **Re-evaluate JSONL append-only as the session-storage paradigm.** Raised 2026-05-20 during the T3.6 PR. We copied the memory architecture (JSONL ledger as canonical source of truth, SQLite as a rebuildable projection) for sessions too. It works, but the fit is partial. Worth a deliberate decision when the seam below starts to hurt.

    **Where it fits cleanly:**
    - Genuine timeline events — `session.note`, `session.decision`, `session.attached` (cross-harness handoff). These benefit from an immutable audit trail you can replay.
    - Crash safety + portability — the JSONL ledger survives SQLite corruption (now formalised by T3.6's projection-rebuild guarantee).
    - Internal consistency — one paradigm to debug, back up, and rebuild from across both memory and sessions.

    **Where it's awkward:**
    - About half the session event types (`started`, `checkpointed`, `paused`, `resumed`, `ended`) are really **state transitions**, not events. We shoehorn "rolling_summary updated" into a `session.checkpointed` ledger entry because that's the shape we have. A mutable row with `updated_at` would fit the metadata more naturally.
    - **High write rate.** Each checkpoint is a full JSONL line. The hook ideas in item #14 (auto-checkpoint on PostCompact / TaskCompleted) would multiply that further. Memories grow slowly; sessions grow with usage intensity.
    - **Cold-rebuild cost is linear forever.** Memories tend to plateau; sessions just keep coming, and the JSONL has no purge story today.
    - The primary read surface (`getSession`, `listSessions`, `searchSessions`) reads the **projection**, not the log. `listSessionEvents` is the only call that genuinely reads the timeline.

    **A more natural split if we ever break the symmetry:** mutable `sessions` row in SQLite (updated in place) + append-only `session_events.jsonl` for timeline-shaped events only (notes, decisions, handovers; optionally status transitions if we want the audit). Classic chat/collab pattern. Cost: SQLite becomes authoritative for the session row, so backup/portability/rebuild stories split between the two stores.

    **Trigger to revisit:** purge — item #12 (physical purge of soft-deleted sessions) is the seam where append-only starts to hurt, since purging requires rewriting the JSONL, which isn't append-only anymore. If purge becomes urgent, that's the right moment to reconsider the paradigm.

## Dashboard / UI

16. **Generate auth tokens from the dashboard instead of static env vars.** Today admin + agent tokens are baked into `LIBRARIAN_ADMIN_TOKEN`, `LIBRARIAN_AGENT_TOKEN`, and `LIBRARIAN_AGENT_TOKENS` at boot — one admin token, no rotation without a restart, no per-token audit. Belongs in the dashboard rebuild scope (not a migration of the existing dashboard — see the standing redesign feedback). Sketch:
    - **Token model:** name/description, role (`admin` / `agent`), bound `agent_id` for agent tokens, optional expiry, created_at, last_used_at, revoked_at. Persisted to the JSONL ledger as `auth.token_issued` / `auth.token_revoked` events so the audit trail comes for free.
    - **Bootstrap:** on first boot with no tokens recorded, generate a single one-shot admin token and print it once to stderr (or a write-protected file) so the operator can sign in. After that, all token management happens through the dashboard.
    - **Dashboard surface:** "Tokens" panel under settings — list active tokens with last-used + role, "Generate" button (dropdown for role + agent_id when role=agent), "Revoke" action. Prefer dropdowns for known-value fields (role, agent_id) per the global UI feedback.
    - **Server side:** auth middleware (T4.1's `authenticateMcp`) consults the token table instead of comparing against env-var constants. Env vars can still seed the table on first boot for backwards compatibility, then become advisory.
    - **Pairs with:** #4 (per-agent tokens become trivial — admin can mint one per agent from the UI); #9 (the dashboard REST auth gap — once `/api/*` is authenticated, the dashboard itself uses its own session token, which can be a long-lived dashboard token issued the same way).

## Priority read

- **#9 is the only real risk.** Everything else is polish or exercise.
- **#4** is the easiest win — once tokens are mapped, dashboard logs and session ownership checks become useful.
- **#2 and #3** are the spec checkpoints that were never formally closed.
- **#10** is small but worth knocking out next time anyone touches the integration packages.
- The rest can wait until the layer is next touched.
